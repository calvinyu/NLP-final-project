VIt's no surprise that were you to peel back the glossy veneer from Hollywood you'd uncover a seething pit of ego-powered corruption, turbo-charged vanity and industrial strength greed.Director David Cronenberg and script writer Bruce Wagner don't so much strip-mine Tinseltown of its rampant avarice and preening narcissism than emotionally frack the place to reveal nary a scintilla of humility or decency.Nobody comes out of this looking good - from Julianne Moore's faded star Havana Segrand bitchily fighting against a youth-obsessed system that's discarded her to homophobic, anti-semitic child celebrity Benjie (Bird) viciously ensuring no-one threatens his top billing.In pimped-up mansions under the blazing Californian sun, this obscenely pampered community never relaxes next to its azure pools but are biliously obsessed with faux status and the accretion of meaningless amounts of wealth.Into their twisted world arrives wide-eyed Agatha (Wasikowska), whose scarred face and arms mark her apart from the flawless bodies of LA's jeunesse dorée but - with the help of limo driver/actor/writer Jerome (Pattinson) - manages to land the job of PA to the terminally insecure Havana.Havana's determined to land the role her (more famous) mother played in a hot new movie but - despite the ministration of Carrie Fisher playing herself - looks set to lose out to a younger model, a state of affairs amplified by hallucinations of her dead mom taunting her.Seeking inner (and outer) peace, she turns to grasping self-help guru Sanford Weiss (Cusack), an oily, Bentley-driving chancer whose own 13-year-old son - the vile Benjie - is terrified that he's being upstaged by a new arrival on his long-running TV movie series Bad Babysitter.In a barely watchable scene, the child star visits a children's hospital where a young cancer patient has to correct his impression she's dying of Aids.

VFollowing its inspirational introduction, the second chapter of the \u000adragon wranglers' handbook continues to pique the interest by putting \u000aits principles into splendidly illustrated practice.With the island of Berk now a model of Viking-dragon relations, young\u000a adventurer Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is keen to put grown-up \u000aresponsibilities on hold while he explores the world with his trusty \u000aserpent steed Toothless.But as the son of big chieftain Stoick (Gerard Butler), expectations weigh heavy on his shoulders - and his one remaining foot.His leadership skills are duly tested when a long-forgotten thorn in \u000aStoick's side - the vengeful dragon master Drago (Djimon Hounsou) - \u000areturns with a scorched-earth approach to world domination.Anxious to stop Drago from turning dragon against dragon (and human, obviously), Hiccup sets out to bargain for peace.Already a diplomatic nightmare, his mission is further complicated by\u000a a crew of dragon-trappers led by the boneheaded Eret (Harington) and \u000athe appearance of an ethereal dragon rider whose identity comes as a \u000ahuge surprise... to anyone who hasn't seen the trailer.This blast from the past takes place on what's essentially the island\u000a twin of Avatar's Pandora, where dragons roam free and the Cate \u000aBlanchett-voiced rider, Valka, slinks around like the last remaining \u000aNa'vi.For a hermit, Valka is a terrible show off.
p1019
tp1020
a(I0
VBut then this is a world \u000aof curiosities, such as how Drago is able to control the minds of \u000adragons simply by bellowing loudly and making circles with a big stick, \u000aand why the younger generation of Berk all sound as though they were \u000araised on the opposite side of the Atlantic to their parents (alas, \u000aHiccup still hasn't outgrown his nasal Canadian drawl).However, as the inevitable confrontations come to pass, the movie \u000acouldn't make its big messages any clearer.

VThe attention to detail is\u000a impeccable, from the showboating sweep of the aerial sequences to the \u000ainteractions and mannerisms of man, woman and beast.Textures and gestures are brilliantly rendered, the body language \u000asaying more about the characters and their relationships than any words,\u000a particularly between Hiccup and his leathery best friend - and his \u000afeisty girlfriend Astrid (America Ferrara).With 12 books in Cressida Cowell's best-selling series, there are \u000aplenty more exercises to come.

VRattling along at a frantic pace, this only pauses between elaborately gory set-pieces (a pack of dogs ripping a slave apart is particularly difficult to stomach) to sharply flesh out Waltz's intriguing gun-for-hire, a ruthless German opportunist who - unlike his countrymen in Inglourious Basterds - is guided by a strict moral compass.

There is plenty at stake as Boris goes back in time to kill K before he lost his arm 40 years ago and remove the Arcnet that protects the world from aliens.Emma Thompson is a welcome addition as Agent O, whose mysterious relationship with K arouses J's curiosity and there's something reassuring about revisiting the white spacious MiB headquarters, where aliens of every shape and size lurk in every corner.

VIts combo of hair-raising behind-the-wheel action, heated off-track controversies and stormy relationship soap is hardly earth-shattering stuff, but Howard and writer Peter Morgan (Frost/Nixon) do squeeze sufficient dramatic tension out of the opponents\u2019 wildly different temperaments, while acknowledging their shared sense of purpose and conviction.
p4214
tp4215
a(I0
VHunt is the blonde-and-blue-eyed Brit, a hard-partying, hot-headed playboy with raw driving talent to spare; Lauda, on the other hand, is a brusquely pragmatic Austrian who doesn\u2019t have time for social frivolities, single-mindedly focused on the race to a fault.

VMcDonagh's screenplay takes its time settling into its groove, but before long we are involved in a reality - some real and some imagined - where there exists a red-masked Jack of diamond killer, a Vietnamese with a bare-breasted hooker, a Quaker who slits his throat and a psychopathic weirdo (played by Tom Waits) with a rabbit, who responds to a classified newspaper ad looking for psychos with stories.The violence is cartoonish and frequent, with blood dripping every which way, but the moments of fear feel real, like the scene in which Gabourey Sidibe has a gun held to her head by Harrelson and we are not sure how things are going to pan out.
