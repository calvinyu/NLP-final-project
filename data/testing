VNow, 20 years after T Rex's tread first rippled the water in the container on the dashboard of the Jurassic Park tour car, we can return to the Park in 3D - and those who have never set foot in it can sample its terrifying beauty.The thrill of seeing live dinosaurs on screen is not as acute today as it was 20 years ago, admittedly, what with CGI delivering cinema anything the filmmakers can imagine.
p4
tp5
a(I1
VBut there is still some 3D awe left in the creations that roared 65 million years ago, stomping around the island, trampling vehicles, eating bulls and goats ... and some hapless humans.The film sets up the basic premise of how dinosaurs were cloned by the wealthy visionary, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) - his team of scientists that is; mosquitoes with DNA bearing dinosaur blood which had been trapped in the sap of ancient trees - amber - could be milked and the DNA reconstituted to generate dinosaur embryos.

VOne disgruntled employee, Dennis (Wayne Knight) sets out to steal some to sell secretly to a shadowy group.His interference with the security system coincides with a storm that hits the island, just as Hammond's grandchildren (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards) and scientific guests (Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldlum), are visiting.

VNo longer contained by the 10,000 volt perimeter fencing, the dinosaurs, and not just the herbivores, are free to hunt the moving targets of meat.It's a long and rugged fight for survival as the visitors and the staff tries to outwit the surprisingly smart raptors.The screenplay touches on the moral questions of the experiment, through Jeff Goldblum's sardonic chaos-scientist Dr. Ian Malcolm, but Spielberg never forgets his audience's thrillseeker side.

p19
tp20
a(I0
VMuch of the action is a bit like a train wreck from which you simply can't tear your eyes away and the film is like a non-stop adrenalin hit with its hyperactive greenback-inspired reality, explicit sex scenes, devil-may-care attitudes and liberally punctuated by ironic humour that will literally have you in stitches.Based on a true story, the action begins in 1987 (the same year Oliver Stone's Wall Street was made), when the ambitious Jordan Belfort begins his lightning rise as a high flying stockbroker who makes his own rules.

p60
tp61
a(I1
VIt's a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the Pacific Ocean is blue.In the first few scenes, we are given a snapshot of the dire situation in which Tim Robbins' bank Vice President Andy finds himself, when he is convicted of murdering his adulterous wife and her golf-pro lover.

VHe is resigned to the never-ending, unbending, cruel prison life under Bob Gunton's bible-loving, callous Warden Norton.
p68

a(I0
VThe story begins in 1947 but spans many years as Andy finds a niche within the prison walls, making himself useful to the Warden and guards by providing 'sound financial planning' (channelling, filtering and laundering their ill-gotten gains).Freeman's narrative holds the story together and like a skilled conductor, waves a baton to orchestrate our emotions.

p93
tp94
a(I0
VBased on a true story, Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano's wonderful screenplay takes the odd-couple concept and stretches its limbs to the extreme, as serious drama collides with comedy that is always carefully contained within its credible reality.Just like in the opening scenes, behind the wheel of a sleek black Maserati that exceeds all speed limits as it zooms in and out of the traffic, there comes a moment when the powerful car comes safely to a stop.

VAfter arriving in Cresap\u2019s Landing, Powell easily convinces the dim-witted Willa (Winters) that he was her husband\u2019s confidante in jail, but her nine-year-old son John (Billy Chapin) is frightened and suspicious of the man with the words L-O-V-E and H-A-T-E tattooed on the knuckles of alternate hands.

VPowell, a misogynist who despises women because they arouse carnal impulses in man, is in constant converse with God.
p1793

VGeoffrey Rush is bloody marvellous as the unorthodox royal speech therapist whose controversial methods include tongue twisters, singing the talk and swearing like a trooper.
p1869
tp1870
a(I0
VCertainly not the kind of language expected to extract from Colin Firth's stammering future King of England during their treatment sessions.
p1871
tp1872
a(I0
VIt may not be quite in the class of The Queen, but there's much to enjoy as we peek behind the scenes of the dysfunctional English Royal Family for a great yarn.The film begins in 1925, when we meet Firth's Duke of York Albert at his most insecure, stuttering his way through his first recorded speech broadcast.
p1873
tp1874
a(I0
VPrescribed smoking to relax the throat and a mouth full of marbles for enunciation do little to help, coupled with the inescapable pressures and expectations from within the family.
p1875
tp1876
a(I0
VThere is Albert's ever-critical father King George V (Michael Gambon at his austere best) and taunting from brother Edward (Guy Pearce is excellent), who is at the whim of the indiscreet, twice divorced American divorcee Wallis Simpson (Eve Best, solid).
p1877
tp1878
a(I0
VIt is Helena Bonham Carter's calm, down-to-earth wife, who provides Bertie, as he is known by those close to him, with unconditional support and who sheds her status like an unnecessary item of clothing to find Rush's Harley Street speech therapist Lionel Logue.
p1879
tp1880
a(I0
VBonham Carter is superb, injecting great warmth and compassion into the character of the woman we would come to know as the Queen Mother.Class distinction teeters like a wobbly see-saw as Lionel tries to find a balance between making and overstepping his mark.
p1881
tp1882
a(I0
VThere are clashes about everything - where the sessions take place, the subject matter they discuss and even what Lionel calls his royal patient.
p1883
tp1884
a(I0
V(Lionel gets his way on all counts.)
p1885
tp1886
a(I0
VThat first encounter between Lionel and Bertie, when Bertie lays down his unconventional modus operandi and pushes his royal student beyond his comfort zone is a terrific scene as is the development of their relationship.
p1887
tp1888
a(I0
VIt is this relationship that forms the heart of the film, describing their awkward, combative initial meetings to the all-important and lengthy war-time speech, when Lionel conducts Bertie, as a conductor would his orchestra.
p1889
tp1890
a(I0
VSpeaking of which, the Mozart, Beethoven and Brahms source music is beautifully integrated into Alexandre Desplat's splendid score.There are many lovely scenes, like the one in which Bertie tells a bedtime story to his Princess daughters, the serious Elizabeth and fun-loving Margaret in the household that already shows its love for the royal corgi and is horse-mad.
p1891
tp1892
a(I0
VI also liked the scene when Lionel's wife (beautifully played by Jennifer Ehle) unexpectedly arrives home to find His and Her Majesty with her husband.
p1893
tp1894
a(I0
VLionel has strictly honoured the code of patient confidentiality, even to his family.
p1895
tp1896
a(I0
VDavid Seidler's screenplay negotiates all the relationships and integrates them beautifully as the storyline reaches its ultimate climax.
p1897

VAs Bertie, Firth gives a fine performance, albeit on occasions slightly mannered.
p1899

VWatching Mike Leigh's Mr Turner is a little like being immersed in a beautiful painting.
p1904
tp1905
a(I1
VExquisite to look at with wonderful cinematography and production design, this portrayal of British landscape painter, J.M.W.
p1906
tp1907
a(I1
VTurner is a showcase for veteran actor Timothy Spall, who embodies the complex man and the world in which he lives.
p1908
tp1909
a(I0
VLeigh's film is hardly a sympathetic view of Turner, who lacks social graces and skills and whose treatment of women has much to be desired.
p1910
tp1911
a(I0
VHowever, it effectively gives us a sense of the times and an insight into his passion for art and love affair with light.
p1912
tp1913
a(I0
VThe opening sunrise shot with a windmill silhouetted in the background sets the scene beautifully.
p1914
tp1915
a(I0
VTwo Dutch maids with white milking caps walk along the banks of the Dutch canal, while Mr Turner stands nearby with his sketchpad capturing the scene.
p1916
tp1917
a(I0
VThis mesmerising imagery is typical of the two and a half hours that follow, allowing us to enter into Turner's world and see things through his eyes.
p1918
tp1919
a(I0
VLeigh canvasses two aspects of his life during its final 25 years - his art and his personal relationships.
p1920
tp1921
a(I0
VBoth are fiery.
p1922
tp1923
a(I0
VTurner is portrayed as a terse man, ever scowling and never pandering to anyone.
p1924
tp1925
a(I0
VThe scene at the Royal Academy when Turner places a dollop of red paint on his canvas much to the astonishment of the other artists - including his rival Constable - is one that is as fiery as any.
p1926
tp1927
a(I0
VI was interested in the scene in which he is offered a huge sum for the acquisition of all his works; his refusal is prompted by his stated wish to bequeath his work to the British nation so all his works can be displayed and viewed free of charge to the public.Exceedingly preoccupied is the description Turner offers his ex-mistress, who is introduced early in the piece, when she visits with his two illegitimate daughters.
p1928
tp1929
a(I0
VThere are few courtesies offered.
p1930
tp1931
a(I0
VNor are there niceties offered to the domestic with whom he shares rough sex against the bookcase.
p1932
tp1933

p1943
tp1944
a(I0
VHow far an artist should be pushed to achieve greatness is one of the questions that is raised.
p1945
tp1946
a(I0
VIt's a devastating portrait filled literally with blood, sweat and tears, leaving our hearts pounding as fast as the intense drumming.
p1947
tp1948
a(I0
VThe music is extraordinary, too.The setting is New York's elite Shaffer Conservatorium of Music and Andrew (Miles Teller) is an aspiring young drummer who wants to leave his mark.
p1949
tp1950
a(I0
VHe lives and breathes music; drumming is his obsession, listening to recordings of Buddy Rich in his spare moments.
p1951
tp1952
a(I0
VTerence Fletcher (Simmons) is the conservatorium's God maker; we immediately sense how vital it is to Andrew that Fletcher notices him.
p1953
tp1954
a(I0
VIt is the cruel, callous way Fletcher operates that gets under our skin as he offers some unexpected words of encouragement to students, elicits some personal information before using it against them.
p1955
tp1956
a(I0
VHe is a monster.It seems as though Andrew's fortunes are looking up, when he is singled out by Fletcher and simultaneously gets a date with the pretty student (Melissa Benoist) who sells popcorn at the movie theatre.

VBut neither opportunity turns out as expected.
p1959

VIn the background is Andrew's father (Paul Reiser), a disillusioned, failed writer who quietly supports his son but clearly doesn't understand musical aspirations or what drives him.
p1961
tp1962
a(I0
VHumiliation, bullying, violence are all part of the mix with chairs being hurled, faces slapped and students stripped down to size.
p1963
tp1964
a(I0
VWatching blood drip onto the drum kit from Andrew's overtaxed fingers and hands, while close to exhaustion, is unsettling to say the least.Teller drums with the passion of a man possessed, the physicality of the performance is astounding.
