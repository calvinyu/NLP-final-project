VThe yardstick lies in the storyline, the appeal of the characters and how that fabulous dancing is used.With familiar themes about rivalry, family and living your dream, Step Up 3D is so intent to dazzle us with non-stop high-octane dancing, incredibly it becomes a bit of a yawn as it plays on one note.

VNow, 20 years after T Rex's tread first rippled the water in the container on the dashboard of the Jurassic Park tour car, we can return to the Park in 3D - and those who have never set foot in it can sample its terrifying beauty.The thrill of seeing live dinosaurs on screen is not as acute today as it was 20 years ago, admittedly, what with CGI delivering cinema anything the filmmakers can imagine.
p788
tp789
a(I1
VBut there is still some 3D awe left in the creations that roared 65 million years ago, stomping around the island, trampling vehicles, eating bulls and goats ... and some hapless humans.The film sets up the basic premise of how dinosaurs were cloned by the wealthy visionary, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) - his team of scientists that is; mosquitoes with DNA bearing dinosaur blood which had been trapped in the sap of ancient trees - amber - could be milked and the DNA reconstituted to generate dinosaur embryos.
p790

VOne disgruntled employee, Dennis (Wayne Knight) sets out to steal some to sell secretly to a shadowy group.His interference with the security system coincides with a storm that hits the island, just as Hammond's grandchildren (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards) and scientific guests (Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldlum), are visiting.

There is plenty at stake as Boris goes back in time to kill K before he lost his arm 40 years ago and remove the Arcnet that protects the world from aliens.Emma Thompson is a welcome addition as Agent O, whose mysterious relationship with K arouses J's curiosity and there's something reassuring about revisiting the white spacious MiB headquarters, where aliens of every shape and size lurk in every corner.

VIt's no surprise that were you to peel back the glossy veneer from Hollywood you'd uncover a seething pit of ego-powered corruption, turbo-charged vanity and industrial strength greed.Director David Cronenberg and script writer Bruce Wagner don't so much strip-mine Tinseltown of its rampant avarice and preening narcissism than emotionally frack the place to reveal nary a scintilla of humility or decency.Nobody comes out of this looking good - from Julianne Moore's faded star Havana Segrand bitchily fighting against a youth-obsessed system that's discarded her to homophobic, anti-semitic child celebrity Benjie (Bird) viciously ensuring no-one threatens his top billing.In pimped-up mansions under the blazing Californian sun, this obscenely pampered community never relaxes next to its azure pools but are biliously obsessed with faux status and the accretion of meaningless amounts of wealth.Into their twisted world arrives wide-eyed Agatha (Wasikowska), whose scarred face and arms mark her apart from the flawless bodies of LA's jeunesse dorée but - with the help of limo driver/actor/writer Jerome (Pattinson) - manages to land the job of PA to the terminally insecure Havana.Havana's determined to land the role her (more famous) mother played in a hot new movie but - despite the ministration of Carrie Fisher playing herself - looks set to lose out to a younger model, a state of affairs amplified by hallucinations of her dead mom taunting her.Seeking inner (and outer) peace, she turns to grasping self-help guru Sanford Weiss (Cusack), an oily, Bentley-driving chancer whose own 13-year-old son - the vile Benjie - is terrified that he's being upstaged by a new arrival on his long-running TV movie series Bad Babysitter.In a barely watchable scene, the child star visits a children's hospital where a young cancer patient has to correct his impression she's dying of Aids.

VFollowing Mason from childhood through adolescence, Boyhood doesn\u2019t just capture this young man\u2019s physical and personal growth, but that of the key figures that orbit him: separated parents (Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke); sister (Lorelei Linklater); and first love (Zoe Graham).
p2519

VWhile Arquette\u2019s performance is a standout, Linklater conjures emotive, naturalistic performances from all his cast, so as the film works its magic and the years pass by, one can\u2019t help but be captivated by the lives unfolding onscreen.

VIt's the unpredictable everyday aspect about the endlessly changing nature of life that involves us in this voyeuristic and fascinating tour de force, and as a consequence, we have a stake in what happens to the characters that we get to know so intimately over the 12 years it took to make the film.When the film begins, we meet six-year old Mason (Ellar Coltrane), an angelic looking boy with smooth skin and generous lips.
p2536
tp2537
a(I0
VHe seems ordinary enough with perhaps a little more common sense and artistic flair than most kids his age; he gets into the usual scrapes at school, squabbles with his nine year old sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater), moves to Houston with his mother (Patricia Arquette) and spends every second weekend with his divorced father (Ethan Hawke).

p2800
tp2801

VBut where Moonrise was awash with wistful nostalgia in its take on adolescence, romance and scouting, Anderson\u2019s latest mines its period setting in service of a broadly comical tale which enjoys frequent diversions into both black and off-colour humour even as a body count amasses and the Second World War threatens to intrude on the borders of the titular hotel\u2019s fictitious homeland.

VFollowing its inspirational introduction, the second chapter of the \u000adragon wranglers' handbook continues to pique the interest by putting \u000aits principles into splendidly illustrated practice.With the island of Berk now a model of Viking-dragon relations, young\u000a adventurer Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is keen to put grown-up \u000aresponsibilities on hold while he explores the world with his trusty \u000aserpent steed Toothless.But as the son of big chieftain Stoick (Gerard Butler), expectations weigh heavy on his shoulders - and his one remaining foot.His leadership skills are duly tested when a long-forgotten thorn in \u000aStoick's side - the vengeful dragon master Drago (Djimon Hounsou) - \u000areturns with a scorched-earth approach to world domination.Anxious to stop Drago from turning dragon against dragon (and human, obviously), Hiccup sets out to bargain for peace.Already a diplomatic nightmare, his mission is further complicated by\u000a a crew of dragon-trappers led by the boneheaded Eret (Harington) and \u000athe appearance of an ethereal dragon rider whose identity comes as a \u000ahuge surprise... to anyone who hasn't seen the trailer.This blast from the past takes place on what's essentially the island\u000a twin of Avatar's Pandora, where dragons roam free and the Cate \u000aBlanchett-voiced rider, Valka, slinks around like the last remaining \u000aNa'vi.For a hermit, Valka is a terrible show off.

p5010
tp5011
a(I0

a(I0
VOf the creatures, I also like the grotesque goblins and the slithering python that yearns for human flesh that might well slither into the dreams of many an impressionable youngster.Perhaps the film's greatest weakness is that there is little interaction between the key characters; the main game is reliant on the ever-nearing showdown between Voldemort and Harry.
p5014
tp5015

VThe screenplay builds on themes of guilt, grief, pain and love to flesh out a story about two sons and a father whose relationship was poured down the sink thanks to the alcohol Paddy (Nick Nolte) consumed in large quantities for many years.The family had split in three, with Tommy (Tom Hardy) and his mum going their way, but Brendan (Joel Edgerton) was a teenager in love and stayed around - not too close to dad, though.
p5027
tp5028
a(I0
VTommy resents them all, especially for being left to deal with his mother's illness and death.This emotional backdrop is established through confrontations between the characters as a prelude to the big fight story, but it is interspersed with short fights to demonstrate that both brothers have fight in their genes - thanks to Paddy, a crusted, forlorn figure whose guilt is palpable.

VJust as Gore Verbinski's rollicking Pirates of the Caribbean franchise let us taste the salt spray and feel the lurch of the waves, here the smell of dust in the vast, arid desert settings almost permeates from the screen alongside the rumbling of the 19th century stream train.

VThe plot is rich and colourful and with a hi-ho Silver, non-stop humour and fast action; there is much to enjoy in the company of the incongruous trio of an in-form Depp, a suitably dashing Armie Hammer and a scene stealing white horse with a personality all of its own.Screenwriters Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio (Pirates) and Justin Haythe (Revolutionary Road) have structured the screenplay so that it is Tonto's recollections of the action that form the exposition.

VFrom 1933, we are thrown headlong into the adventure some 60 years earlier when Tonto and District Attorney John Reid (Hammer) meet in silver-rich country on the train to the future and are thrown, shackled and propelled together for the rest of the film.All the elements of a grand adventure are there with a dash of romance, a deformed outlaw in William Fitchner's Butch Cavendish, a man with a taste for human flesh plus a conniving villain in Tom Wilkinson, whose outwardly respectable, two-faced Latham Cole makes our skin crawl.

VHelena Bonham Carter is a colourful addition as the buxom, flame-haired Madam at the House of Sin whose decorative prosthetic leg conceals surprises even for a Madam.Hammer, with his handsome looks and clean-cut manner is perfectly cast as the lawman who likes to uphold the law by the book and not with a bullet and is a likeable presence, epitomizing decency.
p6251

VBy contrast, Depp's Tonto is a man of action not words and Depp milks the odd-couple relationship for all its worth with his naturally eccentric manner and understated delivery.
p6253

a(I0
VOne of the elements I enjoyed about the film is its absurdities - like the shot of the horse Silver wearing the Lone Ranger's hat and the mayhem that Tonto precipitates as he pops up in unexpected places.The stunts are huge, the vistas arresting and the final climactic charge with its daring action on the roof of two speeding trains is accompanied by a rousing, orchestral version of Rossini's William Tell Overture, galloping along at full throttle.

VThe construct is sound, using Sonny's upcoming nuptials to form its pillars, however, the mood is somewhat tarred by a miscalculation that leaves us with a coating of melancholy, instead of the feel-good vibe for which we crave.Before returning to India, the story begins incongruously with Sonny speeding on Route 66 in a convertible, Maggie Smith's Muriel Donnelly complaining vehemently.
