VFor those addicted to film about street dancing, filled with jaw-gaping routines, pulsating hip-hop music and a flimsy plot to hang it all together, here's another one in the mould. Ironically, it isn't the quality of the dancing that differentiates one film from the other, as a rule it is a given that the dancing will be top notch. The yardstick lies in the storyline, the appeal of the characters and how that fabulous dancing is used.With familiar themes about rivalry, family and living your dream, Step Up 3D is so intent to dazzle us with non-stop high-octane dancing, incredibly it becomes a bit of a yawn as it plays on one note. We feel as though we have seen it all before, and while director Jon Chu makes full use of the 3D experience with an effective, if stylised way of shooting, the routines eventually become (dare I say?) monotonous due to their sameness. Consequently, instead of leaving us gasping by their brilliance as dancers twirl on their heads, leap in gravity defying routines and flex in impossible positions to the rhythmic hip-hop beat, the overall impact is muted.There's nothing new about the storyline, which is basically a retelling of the hip hop fairy tale. The most important decisions are never easy to make, the central characters discover as they journey along the challenging uphill road of dance leading to the fulfilment of their dreams. The characters are pleasant enough, but there's little traction to make them real. Words rather than actions tell us of the conflicts, the angst, the struggles and the fact that it's all about the journey not the destination.Rick Malambri is appealing as the hunky heartthrob Luke whose secret ambitions to be a filmmaker come to the fore as he documents his dancing colleagues' thoughts about what dancing means to them. Paired with Aussie Home and Away star Sharni Vinson as the ever-competitive dance-whizz Natalie, they make an attractive couple leaping over concrete blocks, skimming fences and navigating rooftops under the majestic New York skyline. There's a memorable kiss, too, above a train station, when they are nearly literally blown away. Adam G. Sevani (as the nerdy, tousle-haired Moose) and Alyson Stone (as the ever-patient Camille) are a quirky addition to the cast, following their successful appearances in Step Up 2 The Streets.There's a poorly contrived plot that pits two rival dance gangs against each other as they compete for a $100,000 jackpot and there is little tension or angst as secrets are revealed, loyalties redefined and all the story strands are neatly tied into predictable outcomes. Pipped at the post by Streetdance 3D, this energetic dance film is entertaining enough but doesn't step up to any challenges.\u000aFirst published in the Sun-Herald\u000a\u000a\u000a

VMark Zakarin's entertaining script manages to fuse the warm and fuzzy family comedy with the not too subtle satire as he takes shots at the one upmanship of Bar Mitzvahs 'in certain neighbourhoods' - like the one where the Steins and the Fielders live. As Benjamin (Daryl Sabra) starts to narrate the story of what happened before and at his own Bar Mitzvah, a huge passenger lines floats into view, its bow bearing a giant sign proclaiming the Steins' boy's Bar Mitzvah (which is a Titanic themed on board spectacular). The jokey tone is well maintained, and the serious stuff that the subject touches on is all handled with a brief but earnest touch.The tone is all important because there are several opportunities for fakery, where self indulgence would undermine the comedic plans of the filmmakers. For example, grandpa Irwin comes out of the reservation where he has a gentle teaching job, in the company of vegan earth-linked beauty, Darryl Hanna, whose adopted name is Sacred Feather. This pairing has the potential to derail the movie into different directions, but that doesn't happen.Disciplined direction also helps when it comes to Benjamin's journey, from insecure nerd to self confident young man. Excellent performances from Sabra as Ben, Jeremy Piven as his grumpy dad, Garry Marshall as the contrite grandpa - not to mention Doris Roberts as the forgiving grandma - all help to make the film entertaining on all three levels

Michael Douglas' Gordon Gekko seems almost mild in comparison to diCaprio's Jordan Belfort, whose innermost thoughts, darkest secrets and ultimate fantasies are splashed onto the screen in an unrelenting onslaught of eye-popping revelations. Much of the action is a bit like a train wreck from which you simply can't tear your eyes away and the film is like a non-stop adrenalin hit with its hyperactive greenback-inspired reality, explicit sex scenes, devil-may-care attitudes and liberally punctuated by ironic humour that will literally have you in stitches.Based on a true story, the action begins in 1987 (the same year Oliver Stone's Wall Street was made), when the ambitious Jordan Belfort begins his lightning rise as a high flying stockbroker who makes his own rules. A white Ferrari, a 170 foot yacht, a mansion, a sexy blonde wife, cocaine, pills, prostitutes and more money than he knows what to do with are part of the parcel. Everything is in praise of the dollar, as shown in the film's first scene, when dwarves are thrown mercilessly at a giant office dartboard, on whose bullseye is a dollar sign. If you think that is unusual behaviour in an office, just wait... there is plenty more to come. The lunch scene in which Belfort's first boss (Matthew McConaughey in great form) instructs his new recruit is very funny, with McConaughey beating his chest like an ape on heat as he spills the beans on how to be a success with sex-drugs-alcohol bullets in his belt. That is the first and last time we see Balfort drinking water and refusing an offer of illegal substances.Through Belfort's voice-over narration, we are intimately allowed to access his every thought through his heady rise and fall. There is a sense of the ludicrous in the early days as he starts his own outfit, recruiting dubious salesmen who he inspires to become telephone terrorists by his slick patter and training. Debauchery of lifestyle quickly follows with alcohol and substance abuse and an abundance of sex. Success breeds success and the testosterone-fuelled excesses in the office have to be seen to be believed. Theirs is a perverse kind of loyalty. One of the funniest scenes arrives when there is a delayed reaction to the illicit pills that Belfort has taken, rending him unable to stand, walk or talk - let alone drive his Ferrari. He attempts to do all of the above in what he terms his 'cerebral palsy' phase in a critical situation with the FBI (Kyle Chandler) hot in pursuit by this stage.Former Home and Away star Margo Robbie makes an impression as Belfort's trophy wife Naomi, after who his mega-yacht is named and Jonah Hill is terrific as Belfort's partner Donnie Azoff with the super-white teeth and with whom diCaprio has some key scenes. Watch out for The Artist's Jean Dujardin as the Swiss banker who has an answer to all Belfort's money problems (having too much money, that is); his scenes are highly entertaining. Joanne Lumley as Naomi's Aunt Emma, who helps in the money laundering process is a great addition, as is Rob Reiner as Belfort's crusty Dad.Scorsese's filmmaking is dense and passionate with sharp editing; there is unbridled lust for life on display. The three hours running time simply flies - so much is happening all the time that there is no change of becoming bored or complacent. This is a hell of a ride and ultimately of course, a morality tale.

VThe Wolf of Wall Street opens with Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio) ostentatiously reeling off a list of his various assets, riches, and vices: beachside mansions, private jets, sparkling sports cars and luxury yachts sit perilously alongside gambling, drug-taking, hookers and truly outrageous parties - all funded from fraudulent stock-broking scams.\u000a\u000aTold in a montage so fast it could give you whiplash, the whirlwind first five minutes are an apt introduction to both character and film. Belfort's a man entirely driven by his addictions - sex, drugs, and the almighty dollar - and Martin Scorsese provides, with breathless energy, a deliciously ambiguous portrait of greed.\u000a\u000aAs Belfort, DiCaprio makes for a superb anti-hero, a tornado of charm and macho ruthlessness. With one hand, he shows no scruples for the gullible investors who fall for his slick sales technique (often silently flipping the bird to the telephone); with the other, he fritters his ill-gotten gains on a hedonistic lifestyle approaching absurdity.\u000aDiCaprio's a marvellous fit for the role, and his slimy charisma could charm even the steeliest of souls.\u000a\u000aSuch depictions of (apparently authentic) excess - midget tossing and a five-hooker-a-week-habit among the tamer examples - are riotously entertaining, even if they probably oughtn't be.\u000aScorsese's arms-length approach, directing with a stonking exuberance that belies his 71 years, passes no precise judgement on his crooked cast. It's a morality play with a potentially troubling lesson.\u000a\u000aYet Belfort and his team aren't immoral, they're amoral: existing in a world of dollar-signs-for-eyes, wholly detached from reality. As Belfort's narration admits: "it was obscene, in the normal world - but who wants to live there?"\u000a\u000aWith partying given precedence, Scorsese (perhaps wisely) skirts around the minutiae of Belfort's financial swindles and, it's fair to say, plumbs rather shallower depths than his previous work.\u000aBut this seems entirely in keeping with its shamelessly shallow subject, as does the indulgent three-hour running time.\u000a\u000aThis is Belfort by Belfort: an unreliable narrator taking us on a chaotic carnival ride of capitalism at its most unfettered. For an exercise in sheer self-indulgence, the actions speak rather loudly for themselves

V \u000a\u000a\u000aEyebrows were raised when Martin Scorsese\u2019s real-life drama was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture, Musical Or Comedy. Although the soundtrack (including covers of Goldfinger and Mrs Robinson) is excellent, and it is Scorsese\u2019s funniest film by some distance, Wolf is neither musical nor comedy, more a riotously dayglo Goodfellas. Beginning in a whir of crashing helicopters and tossed dwarves, it\u2019s a filthy, fizzy ride following the spectacular rise and predictable fall of 1980s stock market fraudster Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio). But between the cameos (Matthew McConaughey, Joanna Lumley, Spike Jonze), globetrotting (London, Las Vegas, Auckland) and endless debauchery, there\u2019s a scabrous joie de vivre that\u2019s impossible to resist. One scene sees Belfort vividly miming anal sex while closing a sale with a clueless client. Another has him and his colleagues enjoying themselves on a coke-and-hooker-filled private jet. Multiply that by 180 minutes and you have some idea what you\u2019re getting into. Though brilliantly written (by Boardwalk Empire\u2018s Terence Winter), acted and directed, Wolf is dangerously overlong. This is especially galling because Belfort often speaks directly to the audience to speed the action on. Couldn\u2019t he have whizzed us through the details of his downfall the same way? The only excuse is that the material is just too juicy to cut, and everyone, from a career-best DiCaprio, to his crack-smoking sidekick Jonah Hill, to Scorsese himself is having too good a time to stop. For at least two of the three hours, you will be too. Maybe those Golden Globe guys were on to something after all.

V I couldn\u2019t get that thought out of my mind while watching this visually taxing and noisy spy spoof. Certainly, there is plenty going on in this send up of the British spy genre, not all of it good. Colin Firth stars as secret agent Harry Hart, one of a select group of highly trained operatives, known collectively as Kingsman. The bureau recruits British youth to join them, when there\u2019s a rare opening caused by an agent dying in the line of duty. Eggsy (Taron Egerton) a twenty-something who dresses like rap star Eminem, is asked by Harry to try his luck at the rigorous training program. Much of the film concerns the indoctrination procedures, and I found that to be strike one. The dull preliminaries seemed to last for almost the film\u2019s length. Too much training and not enough story. Get on with it. When the story finally gets going, we learn that billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) has a plan to combat global warming and it\u2019s not exactly people-friendly. Why is the master villain someone who recognizes climate change as a problem that needs to be addressed? Were the producers pushing some redneck buttons by making the bad guy a believer in earth sciences? Strike two. Before launching his plan, Valentine seeks to control the world\u2019s political leaders by inserting an explosive charge into each of their necks, meaning, step out of line, and your head will burst. Many luminaries go along with Valentine\u2019s plan, agreeing to the implants. One of those leaders is apparently President Obama (America\u2019s favorite racial target). It\u2019s possible that the actors didn\u2019t know about the director\u2019s plans to kill the Obama lookalike and his cabinet. These scenes were filmed separately. I can\u2019t see Sam Jackson going along with this, but perhaps he did. The film wasn\u2019t funny in the first place. Now, it was downright Rupert Murdochian. The very conservative Murdoch owns Fox News and 20th Century Fox, the company that released the film. What kind of political message were they sending movie audiences? The scenes in question admittedly happen very fast. Perhaps they were looking for a subliminal effect. Strike three. Now, I wasn\u2019t having a very good time to start with, so perhaps the political messages stood out more with me than your average moviegover. I found \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service\u201d to be derivative, loud and overly broad. Jackson\u2019s lisping billionaire was fun for a while, but then started to get on my nerves. Firth was downright dull. And, Egerton displayed nothing to recommend a future career in acting. Spy spoofs should be fun. What happened?

VA beguiling mash-up of the spy movie genre with a seamless blend of action, satire and spoof, Matthew Vaughn's envelope-pushing film offers hip, lip and zip. The plot flies wildly at times but there's plenty to entertain with gee-whizz gadgetry, a streetwise youngster groomed for spy-dom and a sterling cast including the scene-stealing Samuel L. Jackson as a lisping, philanthropist billionaire with misguided notions about climate change. Based on a comic book by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons, the Kickass screenwriting team Vaughn and Jane Goldman have concocted a heady martini that is definitely shaken not stirred and whose ingredients are colourful and often mind-blowing.After two brief establishment prologues set in the Middle East and the snowy heights of Argentina that leave us reeling with unanswered questions, we are introduced to Taron Egerton's Eggsy, whose Pygmalion transformation during the course of the film takes him from South London punk who mixes with the wrong crowd, to bespoke tailored spy. And as Colin Firth's smooth operative Harry Hart (code name Galahad) tells him, 'a bespoke suit always fits' as well as 'manners maketh the man'. (Kingsman HQ is accessed through an elite tailor shop in Savile Row.) Harry has plenty of opportunities to show the wide-eyed youngster how things work in the Kingsman Secret Service, including the attributes of the bullet-proof brolly that doubles as a stun gun among other things. Eggsy's initiation into the exclusive club (together with other Kingsman hopefuls) goes a long way into endearing us to him, as he shows his strength, courage and clear thinking when put through heavy-duty survival tests. (Sophie Cookson is appealing as Roxy.) The sky diving scene in which they are told that one participant may not have a parachute is terrific. The other contenders are hoity toity types who look down at the lower-class Eggsy.Firth is suitably understated as the spy intent on repaying an outstanding debt - to the point of being a delightful immaculately groomed caricature, while Egerton is perfect as the new recruit, eager to make his mark. Michael Caine and Mark Strong are also part of the team. But it is Jackson whose flamboyant, villainous Richmond Valentine claims the film's key moments. 'No-one can hack into pen and paper,' he declares in one scene, the irony being that he is a technology guru. It helps that his side-kick Gazelle (Algerian dancer Sofia Boutella, amazing) is a svelte killing machine with razor-sharp bionic legs that slice and splice on call.There are plenty of wonderful touches - like the kidnapped Swedish Crown Princess, Mark Hamill's kidnapped scientist, the discourse between Firth and Jackson about spy movies and watch for the elite dinner scene that is MacDonalds with silver service. Many will be at a loss at the controversial scene in Kentucky at the Glade Mission Church when all hell breaks loose. This is the film's most risky sequence and one that will have many scratching their heads and potentially feeling discomfort in the wake of current world affairs and related violence.Sparking with energy and an abundance of ideas, this is a wild joy ride of a spy movie in which laughs, tension, surprises and action jostle for attention.\u000a

With its forgettable characters, more squint-tacular poorly-lit scenes and lapses in logic that would send Mr. Spock into a rage, this is one that can wait until DVD, where you can safely skip it again.Much more family-friendly is the original (and PG-13 rated) Critters (1986), which is what this movie would be if all the viscera was implied and not celebrated.\u000a\u000a\u000a

V it's a joyous, value-added extension of the original." Andrew L. Urban "Almost old-fashioned in concept, Toy Story 2 is a delightful blend of endearing characters and witty storyline bound together by the endless marvels of computer generated animation.  It is easy to be engrossed by these irrepressible, colourful characters that are multi-dimensional and have human in sensibilities.  Toy Story 2 will have you chuckling throughout; you're guaranteed to leave the cinema grinning ear to ear.  There are spoofs on Bond, 2001 and Star Wars, and while the humour is spiked, it will appeal to all ages.  Woody the cowboy, Buzz the Astronaut (with his dimpled Kirk Douglas jaw) and an array of warm and wonderful characters (Hamm the jingling piggy bank and Bullseye the lovable horse are my favourites) are part of a world you want to visit - and may well leave your heart there. (Watch out for Barbie - the toy shop scene is one of the funniest you will see!)   The voices are beautifully cast and wonderfully synched, while Randy Newman's rousing score and poignant songs are spot on.  On one hand, our eyes tell us that these two dimensional drawings are just that, yet our heart tell us otherwise; they are real and have the ability to involve and move us. Then, after the credits have rolled and you leave the cinema, you just might see life from a new perspective - in a cynic-free zone.  You may also look afresh at any discarded toys that are sitting in the corner or stacked away in the cupboard." Louise Keller "Toy Story 2 proves Disney continues to lead the way with in animated features. While it doesn't really advance the animator's art (it looks remarkably similar to the first; albeit on a larger scale); this time around, it's matched with a stronger story that will delight kids and keep adults entertained. Thankfully, the writers have (largely) avoided the temptation to simply rehash the original; although they've certainly delivered what the target audience want. The script, it must be said, is quite manipulative in keeping with the tried-and-true 'you'll laugh, you'll cry' formula. The excitement levels are high though and some sly pop culture references will go over the kids' heads. There are some great action sequences - one involving a group of toys crossing a road is particularly memorable - and the story rollicks along. Some younger audience members may not be able to stay with it for the whole running time (Adam, my 3 year old, got restless for a while about half way through), however the 4 years and over set will be fine. The voice talent is notable. I was especially taken with Wayne Knight as Al, the unscrupulous toy collector; and Joan Cusack as the bubbly gee-whiz Jessie. But Toy Story 2 is really about the animated characters and their adventure in the big world outside Andy's room - oh, and there's a message too. The mix is just right in this terrific film that uses a story for all ages to show off the best in animation. It's classic Disney." David Edwards\u000a\u000a

VImages of the unlikeliest creatures ever devised by nature float into your lap in the IMAX 3D theatre as James Cameron shines his underwater camera lights on the likes of corkscrew coral, albino sharks with wings, pink squid or the unnamed floating shoal-like creature that has never been sighted before. It is flimsier than the finest silk, transparent with what appears to be thin white edging, and the faint reddish marcks of what we can assume to be capillaries - or not - in unsymmetrical, blocky oval shapes. It floats like a light scarf in the water, with no ends, but with a lump that may be its 'body' attached at one point on its circular shape.Visiting the Lost City at 870 metres, we travel with (and inside) Cameron's submersibles as his filmed expedition searches the deepest waters of our oceans. By the time we reach 3526 metres, sunlight has been shut out completely, yet life exists - indeed, it exists in abundance. In the icy channels under the ocean, the earth's crust is weeping lava and heat, with strange, rock formations that look like chimneys, belching black smoke - and heat. It's the combination of water and heat that provides the environment for the most exotic life forms on the planet - including beautiful bacteria. And tube worms with red handles made of plume-like material, among many others.Down in deep water, Cameron stretches his imagination to fantasise about deep space; from beneath the oceans we travel to distant Europa, the second moon of Jupiter, and with the filmmakers fantasies ignited, we are shown in a short but visually exciting hypothetical, what it may be like deep under the ice on that remote part of our universe. Cameron imagines that the life forms on the bottom of our oceans may indeed resemble those on other planets where sunlight doesn't exist - but heat and water might.It's not usual for documentaries to ingest the sci-fi genre, but in this case it's an eye pleasing and mind boggling excursion, beautifully realised and seamlessly integrated into the film.Review by Louise Keller

But appearances can be deceptive. The film is a complex and intricate contemplation on our place in the world and our relationship to it. Rooted in Shinto beliefs, it examines mankind's attempts to tame nature - in the process disturbing its delicate balance. Technically, the film is to anime what Toy Story 2 is to CGI - it doesn't do anything particularly new, but it takes the art form to new heights. The sheer scale of the film, its stunning visuals and its elaborate plot combine to make it a significant moment in animation. If Princess Mononoke has a weakness, it is its 133 minute length which tests audience endurance. The story can't really keep the excitement going the whole time, and there are flat spots. But just when you think the film has gone to sleep; it jumps up and grabs you by the throat. It should be noted that Princess Mononoke is adult animation and definitely not suitable for children; with decapitations, mutilation and blood featuring prominently in the story. Princess Mononoke is a vibrant and exciting film - must-see for anime fans; and a definite should-see for everyone else."\u000aDavid Edwards\u000a\u000a (At left, Memory; Right, Spriggan)\u000a\u000a\u000a

sg4
V\u000aWladislaw Szpilman holds the world record for the longest rendition of Chopin\u2019s Nocturne in C Sharp Minor. He didn\u2019t employ an especially slow tempo; he didn\u2019t indulge in any unconventional repeats; but he did take a good deal of time to get to the end. On 23 September 1939, Szpilman was performing the work live on Polish state radio when he was rudely interrupted by the Luftwaffe. It was the last music heard on the country\u2019s airwaves for many years. After the war, the radio station was rebuilt and Szpilman once again sat at its piano, this time playing the Nocturne in its entirety.\u000a\u000aChopin provides the perfect backdrop to a film based on the true and remarkable story of a holocaust survivor. It is one of those happy fortuities where the music is linked literally to the protagonist\u2019s life \u2013 Szpilman being the master of a copious Chopin repertoire \u2013 and also evokes exactly the right atmosphere. \u000a\u000aThe great German composer Robert Schumann once described Chopin\u2019s music as \u201cguns smothered in flowers\u201d. On the surface there is nothing prettier. The Poet of the Piano\u2019s mellifluous, inoffensive melodies have served equally well entertaining the idle Salon society of nineteenth century Paris, and appeasing modern-day jet-setters who bridle at being put on hold. \u000a\u000aMuch of Chopin\u2019s work is infused with the lyricism of the romantic age. Keats, Byron and Shelley met their tragically early ends when Chopin was in his mid-teens, but we can hear their aesthetic sensitivity throughout his oeuvre. His nocturnes, of which we are privileged to three on this CD, are much closer to what Shelley called \u201cthe hues and harmonies of evening\u201d than the bleak, modern atonality of Bartok\u2019s \u201cnight music\u201d string quartets. They have a quiet, pacific quality; yet there is something stronger simmering beneath \u2013 as if we are both contemplating the drift of stars and sensing their inherent heat. It is no wonder that Whistler used the term Nocturne for his Studies in Black and Gold, with their fireworks and fire wheels set against a dreamy darkness.\u000a\u000aPianist Janusz Olejniczak performs the nocturnes, ballades, waltz, prelude and polonaise represented here with an assurance that is a more than fitting tribute to Szpilman. Chopin was more or less the father of the modern piano style, using the pedal to sustain harmonic tonalities that are filigreed with slurs, trills and other musical ornamentation. Olejniczak finds just the right balance of delicacy with the grace notes, and conviction with dynamics and phrasing. Cinema is tremendously valuable to classical music when it provides opportunities for such wonderful new releases of traditional repertoire. The sparkling production is quite a contrast to the one scratchy, old recording of Szpilman himself, which nonetheless does make for a touchingly nostalgic finale. \u000a\u000aBetween Olejniczak and Szpilman\u2019s interpretations, the pensive, gentle melancholy that undercoats Chopin\u2019s sweetness is echoed in one original cue by Wojciech Kilar. Bass and pizzicato strings, on the down and back beats respectively, maintain a square and constant foundation. A little more tempo and it could be fashioned as a traditional polka; but here a clarinet \u2013 its plaintive melody the single, minimalist layer above the basic rhythm \u2013 evokes a dance of life in the wider sense. \u000a\u000aRe-inventing great music in the form of a soundtrack not only provides a pretext for shipping it onto the front shelves, it also enhances appreciation by associative context. As the guns went off all over Europe, they were smothered by the florid runs of Chopin in Szpilman\u2019s head. There is, in fact, no one who personifies the irony of the suffering artist more than Chopin. In touch with great beauty and feeling tremendous despair; supported then abandoned by the female writer George Sand; and eventually succumbing to depression and tuberculosis, he once asked

But in Amores Perros, what\u2019s at stake is life itself. Not the\u000apredictable movie variety, where the good guy fights for his life and the bad guy always\u000afumbles. In this film, good and bad are less easily defined, and everyday life is more\u000aakin to our own \u2013 or at least the emotional and physical problems are. Don\u2019t try\u000aand find meaning or moral closure in Amores Perros, at least not in the standard way that\u000amany American films offer those pay-offs. There are no simple solutions or ready escapes.\u000aPeople are self-contradictory and sometimes likeable, sometimes irritating, sometimes\u000avile. Tragedy and harmony live side by side, shit happens and love\u2019s a bitch.\u000aInterlocking his three characters in the urban chaos of Mexico City \u2013 the\u000aworld\u2019s most populous place), writer Guillermo Arriaga Jordan, sets out on an\u000aambitious screenplay "to write a script that could convey the pain, confusion,\u000asadness, joy, ruin and hope of life itself." Well, he comes pretty close. It\u2019s a\u000afilm whose brilliance is reflected in the seamless execution. You hardly notice the acting\u000abecause it isn\u2019t \u2018acting\u2019. You hardly notice the design because it\u2019s\u000atangibly real and you hardly notice the score (unless you\u2019re tuned into soundtracks)\u000abecause it vibrates at the same intensity as the images. There is no happy ending,\u000aalthough some would say the ending is tinged with hope for new beginnings, but even so, it\u000ais shot across blackened, charred earth, looking into a distant empty industrial skyline.\u000a. . And yet, you will walk away reeling from the jolt to your senses, and perhaps\u000aJordan\u2019s words will echo in your ear. It\u2019s the whole damn thing."\u000aAndrew L. Urban\u000a"The first and final thirds of this arresting Mexican film succeed in delivering\u000aall the shocks and jolts it intends. A curiously uninteresting middle section lets it down\u000asomewhat but not enough to prevent Amores Perros being a superior example of intense\u000astorytelling. You can practically smell the sweat and hear the pulses racing as the debut\u000afeature by director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu blasts into gear with a furious car chase\u000athat sets the tempo for what's to follow. The terror in Octavio's eyes as he's being\u000apursued by pistol wielding enemies and the gouts of blood seeping from his dog Cofi signal\u000athe beginning of a journey to a place where life exists at its harshest and death hovers\u000aominously. It's where Octavio's dreams of a better life with the woman he loves (his\u000abrother's wife) rest on the ability of the very same brother's dog to win fights to the\u000adeath staged before a frenzied gallery of gamblers. The recurrent image of dogfights is a\u000arisky move and will upset plenty of viewers but works as a powerful and entirely\u000aappropriate metaphor for life in the world\u2019s most populous city where horror and\u000abeauty exist at such close quarters. The animal imagery isn't used solely for shock - it\u000adelivers us to a hopeful place as the heart-wrenching story of El Chivo unfolds in the\u000afilm's final stanzas. It is also present in the middle section but to much less satisfying\u000aeffect. The pampered pooch that goes missing in the apartment of wealthy Daniel and lover\u000aValeria shows us the flip side of the equation (i.e life "above" the streets)\u000abut this segment is far too prolonged and heavy-handed in execution. It's a shame because\u000athere is so much to admire in the rest of this vivid study of chance, love and redemption.\u000aAlthough seriously flawed in its middle, Amores Perros is still recommended viewing\u000abecause for the most part it succeeds in making you feel what the characters on screen are\u000afeeling - no mean feat considering the experiences some of them are enduring." \u000aRichard Kuipers\u000a

V \u000a\u000a	Guillermo del Toro was born, raised, and film-schooled in Guadalajara. But the two Spanish-language films he made before staying in the Hollywood mainstream\u2014where he's been splashing around with big-budget money (or thrashing around with failed or stalled projects) ever since\u2014looked back to Mexico's colonizer. The second, Pan's Labyrinth (2006), remains his most acclaimed and respected work, a kind of Euro-art-film horror fairy-tale. But it's not quite the grotesque, macabre fantasy-masterpiece that some have made it out to be. The story's woven around the legend of a dead princess, Moanna, who seems to have returned in 1944 (post-Civil War) Spain in the form of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero). She comes to a country estate with her recently widowed mother (Ariadna Gil), now remarried to a Nationalist captain (Sergi López) eager to root out the republicans still hiding in the hills. The housekeeper (Maribel Verdú) and doctor (Álex Angulo), though, are clandestinely helping those guerrillas. Family façades, fatherly love and blood-bonds seep out inkily from the shadows. Ofelia's magical-world meetings or three tasks, from the forest goat-god in an underworld lair to her slaying of a huge toad within a dying fig tree and escape from a palm-seeing ghoul at a banquet table, still spook and enthrall. But there's a drawn-out-ness to the plot (the housekeeper and doctor's secret is over-elaborated, for instance) that extends to the time-period being overdrawn. Captain Vidal's such an overstated fatherland (he has daddy issues) fascist: the scowl or sneer, the leather gloves pulled off one finger at a time, the squeaking and polished boots, his brutal murder of two farmers (the violence here can be indulgently explicit), his ominous flicking-open of a straight razor. He seems more unreal, like the evil step-parent of a fairy-tale, than the fairies and fauns around Ofelia. The political history he anchors becomes morbid melodrama; Franco's Spain is too like a fable, a distant, far-off, not-quite-real place. And so the power of the fantasy-plot as an echo of a horrible, all-too-true reality is diminished. In Pan's Labyrinth, unlike in the best grim (and Grimm) fantasies, only the dream-land chills and thrills; the nightmare-truths of our world remain safely distant.

VIf light and the absence of light is cinema's original visual language, so contrast is the language of drama, where good v bad is the first duo, incorporating subordinates like love v hate, hate v love or pain v pleasure. Guillermo del Toro's amazing film concertinas these primal notions in a period setting during the brutal Civil War in Spain. Civil Wars are always rich for exploration, of course, unearthing the most depraved aspects of humanity alongside our most noble characteristics. Now there's a contrast, and del Toro makes the most of it as he juxtaposes Fascism with innocence. The former, he maintains, is what the latter destroys - if it can.The film's extraordinary production design - it's haunting visual presence contrasting with its sometimes harrowing displays of violence - is one of its primary languages. It speaks of dangerous yet beautiful fantasy against deadly and ugly reality.Cast to perfection with Sergi Lopez as the cold, cruel and inhumane Fascist officer Vidal, the film offers a sensory-rich experience on several levels. Both Maribel Verdú and Ariadne Gil shine as the adult women at the centre of the story and Ivana Baquero is wonderful as the young Ofelia, on whose shoulders most of the story hangs.Exceptional effects are scattered through the film alongside the traditional cinematic mis en scene, and the tension never lets up. Pan's Labyrinth is a challenging, confronting and complex work that will haunt you for a very long time.Review by Louise Keller

VIt's far-fetched and a leap of faith of Olympic proportions is required to keep abreast of the plot, but August Rush does deliver some charming moments, largely due to charismatic performances from Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. The unlikely one-night romance between Lyla and Louis, who meet by chance after they have both performed with their respective orchestra and band, forms the heart of this fantasy about a little boy who believes in music the way some people believe in fairy tales. Freddie Highmore plays the young lad who likes music more than food, but there is too much to swallow as he survives the streets of New York, learns to play musical instruments overnight and is acclaimed as a musical genius when accepted into Julliard, the prestigious music school.The premise that Highmore's sensitive musically aware child hears symphonies from everyday sounds like screeching brakes, skateboards, sirens and trains rumbling on tracks, is an interesting one, albeit reminiscent of Paul Currie's 2002 drama One Perfect Day. The concept is well executed, but the script throws up too many coincidences and our ability to believe what is happening is keenly tested.In an Oliver Twistian note, Robin Williams plays a rough, tough, red-head, red-neck, multi-earringed Fagan who uses street kids to line his wallet. Two of these youngsters impress without even trying. Leon G. Thomas III is a knockout as Arthur, the street kid with the big voice and attitude, and so is nine year old Jamia Simone Nash with the cute toothy grin who sings like an angel. Terrence Howard is totally wasted as the sympathetic social worker who helps Lyla and Evan, who is now known as August Rush. Thanks to Russell and Rhys Meyers there is a semblance of an emotional journey, but the film never reaches the heights to which it aspires.\u000a\u000a\u000a

VUsing contempo flash mob dazzle with eye-boggling dance routines laced with sensuality, this fourth film in the franchise (in 3D) takes a leap into the appeal stakes, upping the ante in terms of innovation as all different aesthetics of dance and movement are uncompromisingly pressed together. The formula remains essentially the same with a competition element, a torrid romance and a storyline in which dreams are pursued - this time by breaking the rules. The contrast of classical and contemporary dance with hip and funky movement is a stimulating mix resulting in a sexy, upbeat, energizing experience that makes you want to move in your seat, tap your toes and let your heart race.Set in Miami, there's a distinct contrast between the pizzazz of the palm trees and bikini babes and the neighbourhood where Sean (Ryan Guzman) and Eddy (Misha Gabriel) live. They might work as waiters by day at the upmarket hotel owned by Bill Anderson (Peter Gallagher), but their passion lies in the innovation behind the flash mob events they create. Seeing is believing and in the opening flash mob sequence, the team spontaneously appears on car roof tops as they perform their acrobatic dance routines. Like me, you will probably need to look twice, but incredibly the cars start dancing too - on two and three wheels. Each event is planned like a Mission Impossible bank heist and secretly filmed and uploaded on YouTube. That's the twist on the competition element. Instead of competing against other dance teams as in previous films, the aim is for the clip to go viral which by generating the most hits, will win the large cash prize.Objectives change and the stakes grow higher when performance art becomes protest art, as the group makes protest statements when their home turf is threatened by development. The fact that the developer (Gallagher) is the father of Emily (Kathryn McCormack), the beautiful dancer with whom Sean has fallen in love, adds the predictable relationship conflict. The beach scene in which Sean and Emily meet is a perfect example of dirty dancing - in a mix of one-upmanship and provocative movements. Guzman and McCormack have great chemistry together and we have no difficulty in believing their evolving relationship. The choreography on the beach at sunset is also intensely sexual. Incredibly, Ryan Guzman, who plays the protagonist Sean, has never danced professionally, but comes from a mixed martial arts background. McCormack, known through So You Think You Can Dance is leggy and lovely and both do a reasonable job in the acting stakes.There are very few plot surprises but visually there are many, including the piece de resistance, being the routine set in the art gallery, where dancers wear body paint to match the statues and art hanging on the walls. The film delivers everything you expect and plenty more. It's hot in Miami and the dance moves sizzle.\u000a\u000a\u000a

The dialogue is its weakspot (this is\u000athe subtitled version, not the dubbed) but even so, Metropolis is\u000aa profoundly exciting movie experience. The opening scene is\u000areminiscent of the 1927 film of the same name, and in fact that\u000aclassic film's shadow hangs over the whole work - but only as a\u000ashadow. True, this Metropolis is derivative on some levels, and\u000athere are animation styles that remind us of the faces from Tin\u000aTin, Belgium's favourite comic-to-animation character, for\u000aexample. There are also wild fluctuations in tone, from the dark\u000aimages of a fatalist, noir film to the exuberance of saturated\u000acolours in the sleazier parts of the city. The street and\u000abillboard signs are in English, and the whole setting is somehow\u000aManhattenised, although it's not as precise as that. All the\u000aframes are complex and full, and some of the CGI work is awe\u000ainspiring.

From the ridiculous to the profound, there are many truths in this smart comedy that takes flight from its talented cast.When Seth Rogen's unemployed deadbeat Ben Stone happens to be standing at the bar next to the busty, gorgeous Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), who is excited from her new promotion to onscreen television presenter, little does he know that his life will never be the same again. Neither have any inhibitions when it comes to drinking or sex, although neither remembers much about it. As the perfect odd couple, Rogen and Heigl have plenty of appeal as their characters bond under the covers and then pay the price for the rest of the film. He is a scruffy good for nothing who sits around all day with his stoned friends; she is a beautiful talented girl who enjoys a good time.The joys of the film evolve from the character development of both Ben and Alison as they begin a relationship with nothing in common except the (positive) results of a home pregnancy test. We are there for their ups and many downs. Apatow's wife Leslie Mann plays Debbie, Alison's neurotic sister whose marriage to Paul Rudd's Pete is fraught with problems and differences, and there are lovely naturalistic performances from their two young onscreen daughters. All kinds of things are explored - from individuality in a marriage to the difference between men and women. There's a boys' trip to Vegas, girl-talk lamenting the onset of ageing and even a symbolic earthquake.Apatow treads the fine line between hilarity and sincerity as the emotional stakes grow in the lead up to the birth of Alison and Ben's baby. The critical moments are replete with richness and the wonder of new life is delivered as a monumental achievement. This is a joyous film about friendship, love, men, women and vive la difference!Review by Andrew L. Urban

VThe unlikely combination of a wealthy paraplegic and an ex-crim with a zest for life is the premise of this surprisingly uplifting film that made my heart laugh, cry and sing. Based on a true story, Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano's wonderful screenplay takes the odd-couple concept and stretches its limbs to the extreme, as serious drama collides with comedy that is always carefully contained within its credible reality.Just like in the opening scenes, behind the wheel of a sleek black Maserati that exceeds all speed limits as it zooms in and out of the traffic, there comes a moment when the powerful car comes safely to a stop. Similarly, as the narrative spills into shades of black comedy and almost reaches too far, the reins are pulled in sharply, to bring the action and reality back to manageable proportions. Boasting two brilliant, complementary and perfectly measured performances by acting stalwart François Cluzet and the charismatic, irrepressible Omar Sy, The Intouchables is impeccable entertainment, as its French title translation implies.Philippe (Cluzet) blends seamlessly with his luxurious aristocratic surroundings, art collection, private jet and full time staff. He likes Vivaldi, Chopin and Berlioz and dictates intellectual, poetic letters to a woman pen friend he has never seen. As his paralysed condition demands, he is waited on hand and foot 24 hours a day but it is not his paralysed state that is his greatest regret. He is an onlooker of life, watching it pass as if through a glass window. Enter Driss (Omar Sy), whose chaotic life is seemingly bundled within his tall, well-built frame. He is a street-wise, dope-smoking con-man with no tact that takes what he wants, has an eye for women and no regard for etiquette or class. Earth Wind and Fire is his kind of beat, only recognising well known classical music if it happen to be identified with an advertisement or cartoon. Schubert's Ave Maria is the music that plays as Driss lets his eyes soak up his luxurious ensuite bathroom for the first time.It does not take long for us to discover the unique thing that Driss can offer Philippe and what he craves - no pity. Not intimidated by his plush surrounds, but more like a kid in a candy shop, Driss brings his inimitable brashness and love of life to the once serenely quiet, elegant household. Laughter and the outrageous replace the tedious, everyday events. When Philippe suffers a turn in the middle of the night and can't breathe, Driss takes him for a 4am ride in his wheelchair; they bond over conversation at an unusually empty Les Deux Magots in Saint Germain des Pres. All aspects of a paraplegic's life are addressed candidly including sex, when alternate pleasures are revealed. Suddenly life is filled with laughter and the unpredictable as Philippe becomes a willing participant, no longer an onlooker.All the performances are excellent and the running gag of Driss lusting after Philippe's secretary Magalie (Audrey Fleurot) has a pay off. Anne Le Ny as another assistant Yvonne grounds the scenes at Philippe's elaborate home. Story strands involving the families of both men are also woven into the mix, adding touches of pathos. There are countless magical moments worth recounting - many with humour and involving the clash of the classes - it is not surprising that the film has been a runaway hit in France and elsewhere in Europe. Don't miss it!\u000aPostnote. During my privileged years of working as public relations consultant for Champagne Pommery in Australia, I had the pleasure of meeting Philippe.

VBack together for the first time since There's Something About Mary, both the Farrelly Brothers and Ben Stiller show welcome signs of ripening with age. Based on the 1972 film whose Neil Simon screenplay (based on a short story) was directed by the brilliant Elaine May, this remake (or update) is still coloured by Farrelly outrageousness, but has been harnessed by touches of restraint. There seem to be more emotional layers to Stiller and his Eddie displays deeper chasms of pain emanating from the wacky situations in which he finds himself. When his dream girl Lila (Malin Akerman) turns out to be an uninhibited sex-crazed loony with strange habits and ideas, Eddie is locked in honeymoon hell. There are umpteen opportunities for hilarity in this brassy, funny and wacky comedy in which the cherry is not always the piece de resistance.'What's that?' Lila asks Eddie, when he gingerly suggests the missionary position, after a night-long session of Lila's choice of bizarre sex positions. It should have been the honeymoon of his dreams - at the exotic tropical Mexican resort with illuminated palms, crimson bougainvillea and a pool whose water is the colour of blue lapis. But as Lila turns from sweet pretty thing to a screeching, snoring, drinking, demanding schizo with a troubled past (with her great sense of comedic timing, Akerman is fabulous), Eddie turns to the non-complicated, lovely Miranda (Michelle Monaghan, appealing) and quickly recognises her as his dreamgirl.There is lots of juicy 'business' in this comedy of errors, including a sub plot with a pair of precocious 12 year old twins, the joke-loving moustachioed Mexican Uncle Tito (Carlos Mencia), Miranda's aggressive cousin (Danny R. McBride) and a mariachi band that keeps popping up at the most inopportune times. Stiller's real-life dad Jerry Stiller is a scene stealer as Eddie's lusty father Doc ('You can tell a lot about a girl by her panties') and it is hard to erase the image of him sitting in a hot tub in Vegas sipping champagne with an overly endowed naked blonde. Never mind that the script goes helter skelter towards the end, I must admit I did have fun. And beyond its contagious, wacky humour, the film has a very sweet heart.\u000a\u000a\u000a

VA zippy script injects renewed life to the Museum franchise, offering a crowd-pleasing mix of inventive ideas, quirky humour and impressive visual effects to its star-studded cast. With director Shawn Levy once again at the helm, Dinner for Schmucks screenwriters David Guion and Michael Handelman have cleverly incorporated a twist to the premise of the Museum of National History's exhibits coming to life by moving the characters from New York to London. Smart move; well executed.Hugh Jackman features in one the film's highlights, when he plays himself playing King Arthur in the London Palladium's stage production of Camelot. It's not only Jackman's celebrity and ability to cut through the artifice that works beautifully, but clever writing incorporates Sir Lancelot, a knight from the exhibit, who cannot get his head around the chasm between fantasy and reality. Look out for my favourite Escher-inspired sequence - it's like being caught up in a graphic novel. Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan are funny together; they feature in a fun sequence in a deserted Roman city setting which they have difficulty identifying - until the nearby volcano starts to spew lava. Ricky Gervais is always fun to watch and he is entertaining as the New York museum head who becomes aghast when everything goes awry during a spectacular fund-raising dinner. A brief prelude in 1938 Egypt sets the scene for the film's premise, which involves ancient gold tablets from a pharaoh's tomb whose 'magic' has begun to fade, threatening the nightly awakenings of the museum exhibits. There is also a story strand involving Ben Stiller's night watchman Larry and his relationship with his teenage son Nick (Skyler Gisondo, excellent) who wants to spread his wings before thinking about going to college.I couldn't help but feel rather sad seeing Robin Williams onscreen for the last time - in his role as Teddy Roosevelt. The constant bickering between Larry and the Neanderthals made in his image becomes tiresome, but Rebel Wilson as the London security guard who has a big time crush on the latter is an amusing distraction. Dexter, the mischievous little monkey who gets into the middle of everything, is a real scene stealer and the footage of cats chasing a laser light has a clever pay off.Propelled by its clever ideas, this is good family entertainment, offering great fantasy fun for all ages.\u000a\u000a\u000a

VSurprise hit In Bruges was not going to be an easy follow-up. And some may rue that after a four-year wait writer/director Martin McDonagh has gone the "guys with guns" route once more for his second feature.\u000a\u000aBut, the Oscar-winner spins a standard LA crime story into a meta-mental slice of celluloid: a movie about making a movie that constantly reminds us we're watching a movie, with characters discussing what should happen in the "movie" movie that naturally winds up influencing the movie we're all watching. Kind of.\u000a\u000aAnd Colin Farrell's character is called Martin. Like the director. And the movie "movie Martin" is writing is called Seven Psychopaths. And there are lots of famous cameos.\u000a\u000aIf all this sounds like Tarantino with the smug on full wattage or a film only of interest to filmmakers, rest easy in the knowledge that "real Martin" remains a fresh, smart talent and, after The Cabin in the Woods, Seven Psychopaths is the best post-modern movie of 2012. \u000a\u000aThe plot has scriptwriter Martin lodged in a rut with the Seven Psychopaths script, and manic eager-beaver buddy Billy (Rockwell) keen to help out with tall tales. \u000a\u000aBilly earns a living dog-napping, with pal Hans (Walken) returning the pooches to relieved owners and bagging the reward to pay for his wife's cancer treatment. But, the wrong mutt is lifted when Billy bags the Shih-Tzu of unhinged crime boss Charlie (Harrelson).\u000a\u000aMartin, Billy and Hans are forced on the lam and into the desert for a final showdown with the dog loving criminals.... but like life, sometimes the movies ain't that easy.\u000a\u000aTaking its familiar plot as a springboard, Seven Psychopaths fires its genre conventions into orbit.  "Real life" and imaginary psychopath stories dazzle in a series of vignettes that McDonagh links together through confident and outrageous contrivances, while giving the cast meaty dialogue and spicy situations to chew on.\u000a\u000aSpecial note here to Billy's graveyard set pitch for the climax to Martin's movie that not only allows the film to have its cake and messily eat it, but also contains the subtlest Die Hard joke in cinema.\u000a\u000aWhat lifts all this above Tarantino-pretenders, and Quentin himself if we're talking Kill Bill or Death Proof, is QT regular Walken, the weirdly tender heart at the centre of all this madness.  A moment of underplayed grief and rage with Harrelson and a second Zen face off with Charlie's hoods are reminders of the great man's talent for sad-eyed emoting.\u000a\u000aHe also gets the best line: "I think I have a solution to your Vietcong psychopath conundrum". \u000a\u000aIf you laughed at that, you're going to get along with these bad boys just fine

VWhile his first film, In Bruges was black, fresh and funny, Martin McDonagh's follow up comedy crime caper is less on the mark. The compellingly named Seven Psychopaths feels as though it is trying a little too hard.Notwithstanding that there are some good things about the film, it is essentially a brain-teaser that is ultra black, with a gee-wizz cast and a schlock of set ups that work in varying degrees. The premise of an alcoholic, Irish screenwriter whose scumbag buddies kidnap rich dogs for a buck, is pretty wild, especially when Colin Farrell plays the screenwriter and two pretty convincing wildcards like Sam Rockwell and Christopher Walken play the out of control scumbags. Add the element of Woody Harrelson as a disgruntled Mafia-type, whose adorable Shih Tzu has been snatched, and you have a compelling mix of mayhem that sizzles when it works and treads water when it doesn't.You'll never know who is going to be killed next, but chances are you'll be surprised on pretty much every count. The opening sequence assures us of that. McDonagh's screenplay takes its time settling into its groove, but before long we are involved in a reality - some real and some imagined - where there exists a red-masked Jack of diamond killer, a Vietnamese with a bare-breasted hooker, a Quaker who slits his throat and a psychopathic weirdo (played by Tom Waits) with a rabbit, who responds to a classified newspaper ad looking for psychos with stories.The violence is cartoonish and frequent, with blood dripping every which way, but the moments of fear feel real, like the scene in which Gabourey Sidibe has a gun held to her head by Harrelson and we are not sure how things are going to pan out. One thing is for sure, as a rule, women have a high likelihood of being shot, whereas animals are exempt.Watch for Abbie Cornish as Farrell's Australian girlfriend and Olga Kurylenko as Harrelson's girl, who is also having a fling with Rockwell. Much of the fun comes from the crazy interaction between Farrell, Rockwell and Walken, the latter two often being left to their own ever-spiralling craziness.As for Farrell, he is a good screen presence, and convincing as the booze-addicted writer struggling for ideas beyond his eye-catching screenplay title. We almost feel as though we have consumed (or inhaled) the psychedelic cactus in the bizarre scenes set in the adorable Californian desert, in the lead up to the final shoot out. And let's not forget Bonnie, the Shih Tzu with the cutest face and disposition, over whose tiny body much of the action takes place.Review by Andrew L. Urban

VHowl's Moving Castle is a feast of inventive ideas and spectacular visuals, involving us in a magical world of witches and spells.  There are some truly inspired moments, although this new animation from Japanese writer / director Hayao Miyazaki never reaches the heights of his previous and brilliant Spirited Away. Adapted from British writer Diana Wynne Jones' novel, the story is a character-driven one, but I found the characters surrounding the protagonist are more appealing and interesting than the protagonist herself.The film is being released in two versions - with original subtitles as well as being dubbed (with the high profile voice cast of Billy Crystal, Christian Bale, Emily Mortimer, Lauren Bacall and Jean Simmons).  I saw the original Japanese version, at the closing night of the Sydney Film Festival. The film was well received, although many felt it was about half an hour too long.The film has a European sensibility - from the design of Howl's bizarre castle to the lilting score.   The castle is a wonderful curiosity, a mix of crooked chimneys and turrets, eyes and protruding ledges, that hang together precariously on a platform of four wobbly giant bird-like legs. Great puffs of smoke chortle from the chimneys when the castle is in flight, when the tranquil green meadows and flowers are nothing but a speck beneath.  But you never know where any of its doors will lead; place is a magical fluid and shifting dimension.Calcifer, the talking fire is the castle's engine, and what a personality he is.  With his Casper-like eyes and ever-changing shape, Calcifer has a mysterious relationship with Howl, who morphs into a winged bird of prey, and is under threat of becoming a monster. When teenage hat-maker Sophie is cursed by the voluptuous Wicked Witch of the Waste and transformed into a bent-over ninety year old, she leaves home and finds herself in Howl's castle. She befriends a turnip-faced scarecrow, a spiky-haired boy who disguises himself with a long beard, and a small dog that looks rather like a duster on legs.  Howl has a reputation as a collector of hearts, and Sophie's is immediately smitten.  'It isn't easy being old,' she muses as she hobbles with a cane, but finds many advantages such as wisdom that comes from experience.The detail and intricacy is astonishing and there is always something new to absorb.  Appealing more to adults than to young children, Howl's Moving Castle is without doubt an extraordinary work, that offers more enjoyment in analysis than spontaneously.\u000a\u000a\u000a

VIn the original 1998 Rush Hour, the dynamic between Chris Tucker and still spry co-star Jackie Chan was fresh, and the script was funny. Tucker was the street savvy wisecracking L.A. cop, Chan the tradition schooled outsider.Three years later in the sequel, Tucker and Chan had found their groove, even if the movie did not have as many good laughs and great stunt work. Now, though, it is an awkward Greatest Hits Reunion Show, and neither one of them seem up to the task. Tucker's character is irrational and irritating (imagine biting on a sheet of aluminium foil). Chan still does some of his own stunts, but he's 53 now and some of the stunts he does do cause more concern than wonderment.The story is just an excuse to go road tripping, Hope and Crosby style, to Paris, for the usual jokes about ugly Americans and Europe's begrudging love of them. Believe it or not, screenwriter Jeff Nathanson has an otherwise impressive résumé, boasting The Terminal, Catch Me If You Can and next year's Indiana Jones sequel for Spielberg. Here, though, he phones it in, more of a typist than a writer. The script seems like a collection of action movie clichés, and not in a self-knowing way like Hot Fuzz, either.Tucker and Chan both look bored, and the moment that lazily cast genial giant Swede Max von Sydow appears on screen, the "Bad Guy!" gong rings loudly. While the cuddly Chan is impossible to dislike, this is still the kind of movie that fans feel a duty to say they didn't hate, both because Chan has brought them so much joy in the past and because they need to delude themselves into thinking the movie was better than it was because of the $15 plus snacks they spent to see it.\u000a\u000a\u000a

These aspects of the film prove vaguely snigger-inducing throughout its first act, but in a testament to Spielberg\u2019s powers \u2013 utilised here in arguably his last great adventure yarn \u2013 once the dino-doo hits the fan and giant carnivores start running amok, Jurassic Park still proves as thrilling as ever. The 3D conversion seems to have been approached with the film\u2019s mid-90s aesthetic firmly in mind. Rather than trying to drag Jurassic Park kicking and screaming into the 21st Century there\u2019s a frequent Viewmaster-like feel to the layers that have been created, some elements pulled hard into the foreground while others are banished further into the background to create an environment of great depth. It\u2019s a stylistic approach rather than a realistic one, further playing up the comic book feel established by the film\u2019s early colour palette and scale of its creatures and sets. Once the adventure really begins, the 3D further enhances the amusement park ride feeling the film induces, proving a welcome addition that\u2019s more than the usual thinly-veiled excuse to wring a few more box office dollars out of punters.

V Some say Hollywood is converting too many old films to 3D. But, \u201cJurassic Park\u201d was the perfect choice. There\u2019s nothing more fun than sharing a seat with a snapping dinosaur. I can\u2019t imagine anyone not having seen this 1993 sci-fi thriller by Steven Spielberg. Even if you dislike this type of movie, you probably surfed by it a few times on television and maybe watched a scene or two. I happen to love this type of movie and can even remember where I was when I saw it for the first time. It\u2019s an event movie. The 3D effects are excellent. There\u2019s plenty of enhanced depth perception. And, the raptor and T-Rex sequences are stunning in 3D. There\u2019s one scene in particular where a raptor tries to snap at Laura Dern\u2019s butt, after she climbs into a ventilation system at the theme park\u2019s visitors center. \u201cJurassic Park\u201d was first released on June 11, 1993. And, it has held up over the years, a true classic. It ranks as the 20th highest-grossing film in North America. It\u2019s about $85 million short of hitting the one-billion dollar mark. I doubt if this latest theatrical release will bring that much money. But, there will be plenty of folks willing to visit \u201cJurassic Park\u201d just one more time for some really cool 3D enhanced effects.

VThe original - and the best  ... Michael Crichton's novel, combining the science fiction of cloned dinosaurs, inquisitive children and a lush but remote island, is ideal material for the screen. Now, 20 years after T Rex's tread first rippled the water in the container on the dashboard of the Jurassic Park tour car, we can return to the Park in 3D - and those who have never set foot in it can sample its terrifying beauty.The thrill of seeing live dinosaurs on screen is not as acute today as it was 20 years ago, admittedly, what with CGI delivering cinema anything the filmmakers can imagine. But there is still some 3D awe left in the creations that roared 65 million years ago, stomping around the island, trampling vehicles, eating bulls and goats ... and some hapless humans.The film sets up the basic premise of how dinosaurs were cloned by the wealthy visionary, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) - his team of scientists that is; mosquitoes with DNA bearing dinosaur blood which had been trapped in the sap of ancient trees - amber - could be milked and the DNA reconstituted to generate dinosaur embryos. One disgruntled employee, Dennis (Wayne Knight) sets out to steal some to sell secretly to a shadowy group.His interference with the security system coincides with a storm that hits the island, just as Hammond's grandchildren (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards) and scientific guests (Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldlum), are visiting. No longer contained by the 10,000 volt perimeter fencing, the dinosaurs, and not just the herbivores, are free to hunt the moving targets of meat.It's a long and rugged fight for survival as the visitors and the staff tries to outwit the surprisingly smart raptors.The screenplay touches on the moral questions of the experiment, through Jeff Goldblum's sardonic chaos-scientist Dr. Ian Malcolm, but Spielberg never forgets his audience's thrillseeker side. As in most good sci-fi stories, man's interference with nature has a hefty price tag. This time, it's not just nature that hits back, but man's own self serving nature, in the form of a greedy employee, that sabotages what Hammond had hoped would be a beautiful experience for millions of visitors.Whether 3D adds much to the film is arguable, but it does give us reason to revisit Jurassic Park and remember the delicious fear that we enjoy from the safety of our cinema seat.\u000a

VShe expected to be married with children but Mr Right does not come along, so Zoe (Jennifer Lopez) resorts to her Back-Up Plan, which means taking on motherhood alone. This engaging, funny rom com could well be the perfect chick-flick, as it takes a hilarious look at relationships, romance, pregnancy and parenthood. There's a twist too, as events all seem to happen the wrong way around - like falling pregnant just before you meet the man of your dreams.Of course, this is from Hollywood's perspective and the characters and situations are glossy, exaggerated and predictable. But it works because the issues are all based in truth, and while we laugh at some of the crazy situations, we nod knowingly in recognition. It's a great platform for JLo (seemingly tailor-made after her real-life initiation into parenthood in 2008) and she is terrific. She looks great, her comedic timing is spot on and she has a nice chemistry with Aussie hunk Alex O'Loughlin (Oyster Farmer), who not only looks good (shirt on and off) but is an ideal match for his multi-talented co-star.When Lopez' pet-shop owner Zoe meets O'Loughlin's Stan, who runs a cheese stall at the Farmers' market, there are no hearts and flowers. Quite the contrary. They have an altercation in the rain because they both want to hire the same cab. Fate throws them together and we delight in the hiccups as their relationship is established. There's a candle-lit romantic dinner that becomes a playful war, a weekend at the farm that ends in disaster and awkward scenes in the gynaecologist's surgery. A cute little dependent dog named Nuts also plays a key role.Impending parenthood looks terrifying (or hilarious), depending on your point of view and there are some priceless moments including a screechingly funny bath birth scene at the Single Mothers' Support Group, resembling something out of the Exorcist. Emmy-winning director Alan Poul keeps the action moving and the mood upbeat as cleavages blossom, dresses seem to shrink and insecurities grow.

V"Dan Millman lives in Northern Carolina with his wife Joy ... he's now an author who has inspired millions around the world" so the end credits tell us after this 'inspired by a true story' movie ends in triumphant fashion. Inspiration is the word used around this film, the story of a gymnast who met a mysterious stranger and learnt the secrets of spiritual strength. Strength to live a life beyond day to day worries. He learnt to take out the garbage ... the garbage in his head that was stunting his growth as a spiritual human being.The stranger (Nick Nolte) is a mystical figure, seemingly capable of amazing physical and mental feats. He is a peaceful warrior who is not satisfied when held up at gunpoint to surrender his wallet; he calls the thugs back so they can take his jacket and shoes... He doesn't single handedly demolish them.The film's tone is indeed mystically propelled, but while these elements seem far fetched, the sheer depth of commitment by the cast make us overlook that. Scott Melchowicz is credibly intense as Dan the determined gymnast who changes from an arrogant, selfish egotist to an enlightened human being. Nick Nolte plays the mystic with a minimalist touch and a barely audible rasping delivery that authenticates his other-worldly status. His philosophies put us in mind of those great martial arts legends who rely in the power of the mind to achieve impossible things in the physical world.The story is engaging

VThere is plenty of sleight of hand in Christopher Nolan's The Prestige, a mystifying thriller about obsession, secrets and lies. We learn that a magic trick has three parts. The first is called The Pledge, in which we are shown something that's ordinary. What looks ordinary becomes extraordinary in The Turn and the final act (The Prestige) is the moment when the magician dazzles by sheer audacity. This is also the formula for the film's structure, which takes us on a high-wire act that builds towards a shocking climax. Nolan is a master storyteller and together with his brother Jonathan, has penned this original tale about two rival magicians whose obsession dares them to venture to great heights - without a safety net.Magic, love and deception are the key ingredients, and the main players (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as Angier the Showman and Borden the Genius) are intense. As young magicians working together, their rivalry is healthy. But when a trick goes horribly wrong there are consequences, and Angier and Borden quickly become bitter enemies. They start to harass one another, sabotaging the other's act, never afraid to 'get their hands dirty'. It is that commitment to 'going all the way' that makes this tale genuinely exciting.Michael Caine brings a philosophical world-weariness to Cutter, the designer of the stage illusions, who reminds Angier that obsession is a young man's game. Historic rogue scientist Nikola Tesla (played with panache by David Bowie) and Scarlett Johansson as the willing assistant and mistress are solid additions to the cast.Truth is a slippery notion and the stakes grow higher and higher. I love the fact that Angier is so obsessed with secrecy, he hires a blind stage hand. The fragments of the complex jigsaw finally begin to fit as the final curtain opens for the showdown. The price is high as are the rewards of this breathtaking thriller.Review by Andrew L. Urban

V\u000aA powerful and haunting film that explores the myriad of stories that lie deep within the slums of Rio, City Of God shocks, enlightens and above all affects us by taking us into a world where drugs and organised crime are a way of life.  Often disturbing with its R rated violence, language and occasional nudity, director Fernando Meirelles\u2019s intense and extraordinary film marries the rhythms and flavours of Rio seamlessly with the human drama. Based on a true story from Paolo Lins\u2019 novel Cidade de Deus, effective structure and dazzling editing weaves the 60s and 80s together like a silken tapestry.  The opening sequence is striking and memorable. Knives are sharpened on stone, vegetables chopped by knives, a chicken loses its head, the feathers are plucked, the guitars strum and the mood is set. It\u2019s not until the end of the film that we realise the relevance of this scene and its consequence. While the story revolves around two men whose connection begins as children but whose choices propel them in different directions, this multi-layered film tells many stories of many different characters.  They are all interconnected, and by getting an insight into all these different lives, we gather a greater understanding of how events come to pass and why the characters behave as they do.  Hundreds of inexperienced unprofessional actors worked for months in improvisation groups in order to achieve the authenticity.  The result is extraordinary; the cast is superb. Meirelles is a great storyteller and from the school playground when we meet Rocket and Lil Dice, we quickly learn that to be a hood you need more than guns, you need ideas. We feel the heat, breathe the dust, smell the squalor and sense the rhythms.  We get a sense of what life is like on the streets \u2013 guns are passed out to kids like candy. They begin as drug delivery boys before becoming dealers and managers. I found it almost too hard to watch the scene when a boy is forced to kill one of two children crying on the gutter. To make matters worse, he has to choose which one to kill. This is a tough film and one that is impossible to watch without becoming involved. Effective cinematic techniques including split screen, accelerated movement and occasional rewinds of the action, all of which is accentuated by the constantly inventive and outstanding editing.  The visceral music pumps its way through our veins for the entire 130 minutes, colouring the violence with the very brush that is Rio. And as the fates of Rocket and L\u2019il Ze (formerly Dice) come together, they face each other with two very different weapons

V Tornatore is a wonderful       artist and this is a worthwhile attempt at a grand, unusual drama. It is its earnest,       heavy handed style that works against the film, with overblown filigree of elements that       not so much decorate as weigh it down. The repetitious nature of the story structure, the       clumsy time shifts back and forth, the over-worked use of visual and physical symbolism       and the unsatisfactory creation of the central character all make it hard for an audience       to participate. Not that Tim Roth fails to evoke character - it's just that we are told       about him rather than allowed to discover him. Occasionally mawkish, frequently       melodramatic and sometimes laboured, The Legend of 1900 is clear in its emotional       intentions and ambitious in its intellectual objectives but fails by its story telling       complexity - an irony audiences will recognise in one of the film's subtexts, about the       importance of having a story to tell if all else is lost."

It's a line about grandma's behaviour at a crucial point.

It's also full of stairs with balustrades down which to slide, rooftop satellite antenna which to destroy and a wonderful cellar, too.The gadgets and gizmos are fun, the romantic play between Robert Hoffman's Ricky and Ashley Tisdale's Bethany is like a running gag with bonus extras in the form of an alien gizmo that takes control of humans, and Doris Roberts gets into the swing of it all as Nana, the grandma whose false teeth have a cameo role.The screenplay is clear and well structured in the Hollywood mode, and John Schultz directs proceedings with a sense of fun.

Urban\u000a"In a film full of memorable lines the one which summed up the world of Brett\u000a     Easton Ellis' novel and this screen adaptation is spoken by one of Patrick Bateman's\u000a     co-workers. As the conversation turns inevitably to restaurants and where they should eat\u000a     to score maximum status points one says "I'm not really hungry but I'd just like to\u000a     know I've got a reservation". Appearance is everything. This ferociously funny satire\u000a     based on the most maligned novel of the 90's could be subtitled A Nightmare On Wall St as\u000a     the blank space known as Patrick Bateman becomes the ultimate metaphor for the grisly\u000a     hedonism which drove the 1980's and remains active, though less conspicuous, today. If\u000a     anyone had trouble accepting the metaphors in Brett Easton Ellis' writing, Mary Harron's\u000a     brilliant film leaves us in no doubt that, in the characters own words, he is "simply\u000a     not there". Not as flesh and blood but as a potent symbol of moral and spiritual\u000a     decay in western industrial economies cannibalised by consumerism and the superficial.\u000a     Director/co-writer Mary Harron gets everything right here. Bateman is an idea borne of\u000a     disgust and indulgence for its own sake. His victims, importantly, are very real; they are\u000a     the disenfranchised without eggshell coloured business cards and entree to the nothing\u000a     masquerading as something that is Bateman's world. The comic book violence becomes\u000a     uncomfortably real as Bateman's spree intensifies; early laughter at his long-winded\u000a     analysis of Whitney Houston and Phil Collins songs subsiding as the brutality of a system\u000a     which creates the notion of a Patrick Bateman is realised. Performances are superb\u000a     all-round, with Bale mesmerising whether relating the details of his face-pack and\u000a     stomach-crunch morning ritual or wielding a chainsaw down a corridor. Chloe Sevigny's\u000a     doe-eyed looks work perfectly as his mousy secretary and Reese Witherspoon a shrill\u000a     delight as his vacuous girlfriend - the embodiment of a "social x-ray" from\u000a     Bonfire Of The Vanities. Rounded out with crisp, antiseptic photography and a soundtrack\u000a     mixing the brilliant and the deliberately banal, this is a powerhouse journey into the\u000a     dark side."\u000aRichard Kuipers\u000a"Few books have caused more controversy in recent times than Bret Easton\u000a     Ellis\u2019 American Psycho (if you buy it in Australia, it will be sealed in plastic) and\u000a     now the story hits the big screen. Despite what you may have heard, this film is\u000a     definitely not a slasher or horror movie; although it is horrific in its own way. American\u000a     Psycho is an examination of evil lurking amongst us; and of our blithe ignorance of it so\u000a     as not to disturb our otherwise "perfect" lives. It challenges us to consider\u000a     the very value of human life in a materialistic society. That\u2019s not to say the film\u000a     isn\u2019t entertaining - it\u2019s engaging, very funny and the plot moves along at a\u000a     pace. For the squeamish, don\u2019t worry. In the tradition of Hitchcock, virtually all\u000a     the violence takes place off-screen (which is to say, in your head). As the dapper but\u000a     disturbed Bateman, Christian Bale turns in one of the best performances of the year so\u000a     far. He\u2019s clearly studied Peter Lorre\u2019s whistling psychopath in Fritz\u000a     Lang\u2019s classic M (a thematically similar film). His blend of surface style and dark\u000a     underbelly is wonderful to watch. Oscar nominee Chloe Sevigny gets limited screen time as\u000a     his doe-eyed secretary; but is entirely convincing. Reese Witherspoon is achingly\u000a     "80s" as Evelyn; Samantha Mathis\u2019 Courtney is ennui personified; and Willem\u000a     Dafoe does his best Columbo as the smarter-than-he-looks detective. American Psycho is an\u000a     exciting and disturbing film. Whether you ultimately like it or not, you won\u2019t soon\u000a     forget it. And you\u2019ll never look at a business card the same way again." \u000aDavid Edwards\u000a\u000a

V \u000a\u000a\u000aWinning kids over with its cartoonishness, adults with its wittiness, and stoned college students with its absurdness, Sponge Out of Water is an animated Monty Python movie you can take the whole family to. With absolutely no interest in teaching morals or life lessons with a straight face, the film stays true to the essence of the Spongebob phenomenon: delivering pure laughs in every surreal, bonkers way it can. A brief description of the plot will give you a taste of the lunacy on offer: Bikini Bottom literally jump-cuts into chaos when the Krabby Patty formula goes missing. The town\u2019s only hope is Spongebob, Plankton, and a time machine made from a photo-booth and day-old nachos. That\u2019s the tip of this insanity iceberg, one that is filled with an impressive variety of jokes that span from delightfully childish visual gags to oddball one-liners (\u201cWelcome to the apocalypse; I hope you like leather\u201d). There\u2019s even a sugar-coated reference to Stanley Kubrick\u2019s The Shining. The animators have done a flawless job with the \u201cout of water\u201d leap from 2D to 3D, though it only makes up 15 minutes of the film. However, keeping human interaction to a minimum prevents it from feeling too distant from the \u2018bob world we love (an effect I call \u2018Smurfing it up\u2019). The only jokes that flop with a thud are the ones that recycle material used in the series. The biggest offender is a tame musical number where Spongebob teaches Plankton about teamwork, which is nowhere near as F.U.N. as the original song. But this is merely one of a few dud bullets coming from a movie that duel-wields machine guns loaded with gags.

VNothing is impossible in his no holds barred thrilling actioner in which cars leap from planes, skyscrapers and cliff-tops as stunts accelerate to levels that almost break the sound barrier. Like the previous six films of the franchise, speed, audacity, smarts and brute strength are the drivers, but the importance of family grounds the narrative, never more so than here, following the tragic death of Paul Walker in an accident before filming was completed. While the shadow of Walker's death hovers, the film is a joyous and unadulterated celebration of the essence of the franchise and in particular the brotherhood between Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto and Walker's Brian O'Conner. It takes a while for the film to get going, as the storyline concentrates on the return of Dominic's amnesiac squeeze Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez with attitude) and Brian's difficulty adjusting to his new role as a family man cordoned off behind a white picket fence. It's the bullets he misses, he says. But then a new assignment comes along, involving Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham, compact and deadly), a special forces assassin bent on revenge, a mercenary called Jakande (Djimon Hounsou, enigmatic), and an elusive (and extremely shapely) hacker called Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel, delightful) whose highly sought after God's Eye app allows every camera and audio device to be tracked. Kurt Russell's Intelligence Officer Petty cleverly puts them all together.The sequence in which the cars drive out of the back of a plane thousands of feet in the air to hijack an armoured vehicle in remote Azerbaijan is the craziest thing ever, complete with team members strapped into drivers' seats. There are countless heart-stopping moments as the souped-up vehicles bounce as if on a trampoline on the rough and perilous mountain roads. Another highlight is the Abu Dhabi party scene complete with a punchy girl-fight in which elegance plays no part, despite stilettos and long gowns. And there is the incredible moment when Vin Diesel drives his car through a skyscraper glass window and landing.... well, you will have to see the film to find out. Cars crash, spin and fly; buildings crumble while bullets pelt and grenade explode... I sat on the edge of my seat throughout, flinching, wincing, gasping and ultimately sighing with relief.Director James Wan has done an extraordinary job pulling everything together, with credit to the editing team and the music that keeps the adrenalin beating. The cast all delivers as expected with Statham a convincing baddie whose philosophy that 'My enemy's enemy is my friend (and I have a lot of friends)' pays off. Dwayne Johnson is there, too - larger than life and there are some wry humour thrown in here and there. As for Diesel, he continues to mumble in that deep gravelly baritone and it's a fitting and moving farewell for the charismatic, blue-eyed Walker, who will be missed but not forgotten.\u000a

V Generally speaking, I don\u2019t like them. The 2011 version of \u201cThe Thing\u201d is a bit of an exception. Nothing will ever replace the awe and horror of 1982\u2019s \u201cThe Thing\u201d by John Carpenter. The special effects were state-of-the-art in the early 1980\u2019s, making a huge impression on me at the time. The 2011 prequel has much more impressive effects, but the story had only one place to go, and that\u2019s to the beginning of 1982 story. In other words, diehard Carpenter fans know how this all must end. But, true horror afficionados can enjoy a good blood-letting all the same. This new version has decent creature effects and moderately sympathetic characters. Anyway, a team of Norwegian and American scientists discover an alien spacecraft deep in the ice of Antarctica. They also discover the remains of an alien near the ship. It\u2019s the biological aspect of this dig that fascinates them. Among the Americans is Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who warns against working too fast to examine the frozen remains. Of course, she\u2019s ignored and all hell breaks loose. Hey, she had to be ignored or this would have been nothing more than a boring science project. Instead, the creature comes alive and is really pissed off. Oh, yes. There will be blood. The creature attacks by absorbing its victims and then replicates them into something that\u2019s not quite human. Like the Carpenter film, the question becomes \u201cwho is human and who wants to make breakfast out of your brain?\u201d\u000a\u201cThe Thing\u201d is not half as good as the Carpenter film, but it has enough shocks and scares to keep you interested.

p175
sg4
VIn what is billed a prequel to John Carpenter's 1982 original, the filmmakers are able to escalate the visual and special effects using the latest digital tools, to great .. er .. effect. The thing about 'the thing' in The Thing is that it can replicate the human body, hide inside it, without affecting human functionality - including personality, speech, etc. It's a truly horrific concept, and it is manifested through a truly horrific creature. I won't go into details, except to say the effects work in some scenes is astonishing.But before we get to those scenes, there is a dramatic opening sequence to establish the scenario, with Ulrich Thomsen (one of my favourite Scandinavian actors) as the headstrong scientist whose single minded, perhaps careless interest in the creature leads toTrouble. This is all how it should be in the genre, which punishes man's interference with nature or even with alien life forms, with nasty payback.That's why, like in so many such stories, there is no logical motive for the thing killing humans with such passion and determination.Unlike early sc-fi movies made for the Saturday matinee sessions, filmmakers have in recent times turned to acclaimed actors to push the film's appeal into broader audiences. Hence Thomsen and the rest of the cast, including Aussie Joel Edgerton, who also stars in Warrior, which releases in Australia just two weeks after The Thing. Also notable is a terrific performance by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She is really the star of the show, further proof that woman are increasingly well represented at all age groups and across all genres. Winstead is bright, engaging and totally credible as the palaeontologist Kate Lloyd.The Norwegian cast of character actors reminds us of the depth of talent in European cinema Australians hardly ever get to see, and the film's production values are first class. Marco Beltrami's gingery score is great and if you stay for the end credits you will be rewarded not only by an unsettling coda which is used to explain why the film is a prequel, but also a lovely end theme by none other than Ennio Morricone.And don't arrive late or you'll miss the raunchy little Norwegian joke before the bad things start.\u000aReview by Louise Keller

VThe one thing a remake can never be is original. But the 1984 original was a big hit and spawned three sequels (as well as a video game). But these haven't been seen by the new generation of movie kids so Robert Mark Kamen has helped write another version, with veteran Jerry Weintraub again producing. This time the story is set in China, where the 12 year old Dre (Jaden Smith) finds himself bullied at his new Beijing school. In the original, Pat Morita played the wise old martial arts master, Mr Miyagi. This time it's the likeable Jackie Chan, but even his ruggedly charming persona doesn't quite ring all the bells - but it's not his fault. The script and direction let him down. His martial arts work (including all the training, stunts and choreography, are superb.)The film, made as a co-production with the Chinese Government film company, goes to great lengths to show us the China the beautiful. The travelogue - like aerial shots of Dre training [inexplicably] on the Great Wall of China - is lovely but it pads out the film, which is already swollen with unnecessary elements. It runs 140 minutes, and wears out its welcome.Not that it's a bad film

V \u000a\u000a\u000aAs a stress-inducing exercise in cinematic asphyxiation, Whiplash is this year\u2019s Gravity. Where Alfonso Cuarón\u2019s film placed an astronaut into merciless space, writer-director Damien Chazelle chucks 19-year-old jazz drummer Andrew (Miles Teller) into the merciless grasp of a brutal music instructor (JK Simmons). And just like Gravity, Whiplash is bound for Oscars. Teller\u2019s performance transcends his previous roles, infusing Andrew with natural innocence slowly warped by a necessary arrogance as he seeks to \u201cbe the best\u201d. This passion drives him, but also traps him in the torturous tutelage of Fletcher, played by the brilliantly frightening Simmons. Andrew wants to please Fletcher, but Fletcher keeps the bar drastically out of reach by implementing physical and psychological cruelty that is not only sickening, it\u2019s calculated \u2013 a method he\u2019s refined to an abusive art-form. The tension comes from how far Andrew is willing to stretch himself to get to that impossible bar, and whether or not he\u2019ll snap in the process. Adding elements of claustrophobia to Fletcher\u2019s fearful classroom, Chazelle confines his shots to confronting close-ups and superb macro-photography of sweat-covered cymbals and Andrew\u2019s bleeding hands. Outside of practice, the filmmaking simplifies, creating a contrasting sense of ease. A rigid subset of audiences may not accept the plausibility of the scenarios (again, like Gravity), but those who submit to the film will be treated to a masterful finale that stills the lungs and silences the mind. At its last beat of the drum, Whiplash allows you to exhale, only to force you into another quandary: do you applaud in admiration or quiver in horror?

VThrilling and disturbing in equal parts, Damien Chazelle's magnificent film Whiplash, about a young jazz drummer obsessed with greatness and the sadistic teacher who pushes him to the brink, is a showcase in which fear, not harmony reigns. J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller offer superlative and unforgettable performances, as their characters duel as if in a fight to the death. Words cannot describe the terror, tension and ferocious power of the film in which ambition and intimidation are discordant bedfellows. How far an artist should be pushed to achieve greatness is one of the questions that is raised. It's a devastating portrait filled literally with blood, sweat and tears, leaving our hearts pounding as fast as the intense drumming. The music is extraordinary, too.The setting is New York's elite Shaffer Conservatorium of Music and Andrew (Miles Teller) is an aspiring young drummer who wants to leave his mark. He lives and breathes music; drumming is his obsession, listening to recordings of Buddy Rich in his spare moments. Terence Fletcher (Simmons) is the conservatorium's God maker; we immediately sense how vital it is to Andrew that Fletcher notices him. It is the cruel, callous way Fletcher operates that gets under our skin as he offers some unexpected words of encouragement to students, elicits some personal information before using it against them. He is a monster.It seems as though Andrew's fortunes are looking up, when he is singled out by Fletcher and simultaneously gets a date with the pretty student (Melissa Benoist) who sells popcorn at the movie theatre. But neither opportunity turns out as expected. In the background is Andrew's father (Paul Reiser), a disillusioned, failed writer who quietly supports his son but clearly doesn't understand musical aspirations or what drives him. Humiliation, bullying, violence are all part of the mix with chairs being hurled, faces slapped and students stripped down to size. Watching blood drip onto the drum kit from Andrew's overtaxed fingers and hands, while close to exhaustion, is unsettling to say the least.Teller drums with the passion of a man possessed, the physicality of the performance is astounding. As for Simmons, his performance is breathtaking

V\u000aWith ten times the budget and a more clearly defined narrative than the first Mad Max,\u000aGeorge Miller and producer Byron Kennedy travelled to Broken Hill and returned with what\u000ais quite simply the best action-exploitation film ever made. The influence of Mad Max 2\u000acannot be overestimated. Besides providing the Italian and Filipino film industries with\u000athe inspiration for a decade's worth of rip-offs (Exterminators of the Year 3000, The New\u000aBarbarians, 1990 Bronx Warriors, Equalizer 2000 to name a few) this 94 minute exercise in\u000apure cinema re-wrote the rule book for on-screen excitement. The final chase scene has no\u000apeer and is unlikely to ever have one. Mad Max 2 is about much more than stunts and\u000avisceral thrills. Modelled along classic western and samurai film lines it also has a\u000awicked and consistent sense of humour that begins with Bruce Spence's wonderful turn as\u000athe Gyro Captain ('that's my snake, I caught it and I'm gunna eat it') and is maintained\u000aeven in the incredibly tense escape scene as the mechanic played by Steve J. Spears\u000acatches fire while fending off the goons. Compare that with the one-liners in films such\u000aas Terminator 2 that stick out like sore thumbs.

VRemember when armed revolution was flavour of the month in both America and Europe, and a film that made heroes out of Arab "terrorists" could get praised in the New York Times? Me neither. But if the political moment of The Battle Of Algiers seems impossibly remote, the film still speaks to us as a historical document and as a study of the morality of violence. When is killing civilians justified to serve a "higher" purpose? What about torture?These questions are as up-to-date as ever, though I'm not sure the filmmaker, Gilles Pontecorvo, has thought hard enough to give very satisfactory answers. Consciously, his stylistic aim might be to fuse the neo-realist view of cinema as a window on the world with Sergei Eisenstein's radical notion of cinema as a series of physical and intellectual shocks.The roving crowd scenes, shot with the telephoto lens, seem aimed at simulating the chaos of life in the raw, while minimising individual psychology in order to focus on the shared struggle. But this could also be understood as a formalist or escapist approach, freeing us to experience violent acts (massacres, bombings) largely in terms of exciting, pleasurable sound and movement.At the least, the audience is invited to enjoy the thrill of violence in a righteous cause

For me it certainly is, even though              it's not hard to take issue with certain aspects, from the sometimes simplified characters              to the seen-that-prison-routine-before scenes. The Green Mile rises above its              cliché-driven origins by some fine script writing, directing (Darabont cut his              mystic-prison-movie teeth on The Shawshank Redemption) and the sheer force of the              performances. Tom Hanks is superb, combining Edgecomb's nobility of spirit with a down to              earth humanity, always juggling his job and his conscience like a performer juggling two              very different objects. He lets us see and feel inside his character and maintains this              connection as he lives through the events of the story. There are equally impressive              performances from David Morse and Doug Hutchison as wardens with opposing personalities,              and a passionate principal support performance from Michael Clarke Duncan as the convicted              rapist & murderer with a special gift. This gift is the central motor of the story,              and one which helps deliver its 'moral closure' - so that we go home, re-confirmed in the              power of good over evil - if only just. Magnificently scored by Thomas Newman, rivetingly              edited by Richard Francis-Bruce and stunningly designed by Terence Marsh, The Green Mile              is fuelled by its power-pack cinematography. The Stephen King material gains in gravitas              as a result - and should keep you still in your seat for its running time." Andrew L. Urban "Music is the emotional trigger for recollections of The Green Mile \u2013 that              tightrope in time without safety net for prisoners awaiting execution. Pretty grim, you              might think. Nothing will prepare you for the surprises in store \u2013 from the brutally              cruel to the warmly funny. Extraordinarily powerful and overwhelmingly moving, The Green              Mile tells the black and white story of humanity. But there's beauty in the black and              there's ugliness in the white \u2013 nothing is straightforward. We are told that 'what              happens on the mile stays on the mile'. It is these secrets and confidences that bond the              men together \u2013 those who work there and those who are awaiting their date with fate.              In this violent environment, it is especially touching to meet gentle compassion.

Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity) delivers pace and action, although eventually the action scenes become rather monotonous in the final reel.The plot is wildly over the top, but the script works the premise rather well, delivering both inspired lines and moments when we laugh knowingly at the nebulous institution of marriage, which is what the film is all about.  'We'll talk about this later,' John mumbles, when Jane accidentally knifes him in the leg, and in another scene, he snarls that it may not be a good idea for Jane to undermine him in front of their hostage. There's plenty of black irony in Jane's supposition that 'Happy endings are just stories that haven't finished yet.'Mr and Mrs Smith is certainly an enticing escapist film.  The notion of putting two assassins from competing agencies in one marital bed is delicious, and we are quickly brought up to date with John and Jane's relationship during the past five or six years, from the time they met in Colombia, share their first kiss in the rain to their nightly pre-dinner dry martini at 7. The plot is not the surprise; it is all about HOW John and Jane learn about each other and HOW HIGH the temperature rises between Brad and Angelina.  Onscreen together, they make the perfect couple, as they jostle physically and verbally.  The banter is playful and anyone who has ever had a relationship will relate to the ongoing everyday situations. 'If you don't like the new curtains, we can take them back' Jane cooes with her classic rosebud mouth. But when John says 'I don't like them,' Jane simply smiles and says 'You'll get used to them.'When we first meet them in their perfect home in New York, they are leading a routine, rather mechanical life.  Although how routine and mechanical anyone can consider Jane, wearing a tight skirt and stilettos, adjusting the drapes from the arms of a swinging rocking chair, is academic. Neither knows of the other's stash - John has guns hidden in his tool shed, and Jane keeps a secret supply of razor-sharp knives locked in a cache in her oven. They each guard their secret life as an assassin carefully, making regular nightly excursions alone. It's amusing to see the close calls, like the scene when Jane quickly changes from her tight, black leather dominatrix outfit (part of a hit disguise) into a pretty pink dress for a soiree at a neighbour's house.The action scenes are as wild as the premise, with cars flying in the air, big explosions, car chases and extravagant stunts. The action, driven by a thrilling score, is eye-popping stuff and if you are ready for this outrageous extravagance of plot and Hollywood excess that makes humorous but shrewd observations about marriage, you will have a ball. Take your partner - you will no doubt laugh knowingly together at the super sharp observations about relationships.Review by Mr. Urban

V \u201cA Most Violent Year\u201d crackles with good acting, but fizzles from its slow pacing. Most of all, it reminds you of better films from the 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s. Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain are the husband-and-wife owners of a small, but growing, fuel oil business in New York City, 1981. It\u2019s explained that 1981 was one of the most violent years in the city\u2019s history. And, a growing source of tension is the highly competitive fuel oil business. Despite the seemingly endless hijackings of his vehicles, Abel Morales (Isaac) is determined not to respond in kind. He wants peace and prosperity, but it seems like one or more of his competitors wants to drive him out of business. The financial strain and an ongoing investigation of his company by a local prosecutor adds to the pressure. Morales finds little moral support in his wife, Anna (Chastain). Her late father ran the company like the people he was in business with. Someone hits you, you hit back. Her husband\u2019s attempts to take the high ground are doubted by not only his wife, but his employees. Morales, nevertheless, attempts to persevere against the violence, decay and corruption. You would think a film entitled \u201cA Most Violent Year\u201d would bring suspense and action to its intriguing premise, but instead it stubbornly insists on slowing things down to the point that you start thinking about similar films, the Sydney Lumet classic, \u201cSerpico,\u201d for example. Isaac just can\u2019t compete with someone like Al Pacino in his prime, at least not with this dull material. And, it\u2019s not his fault. Isaac and Chastain will both get kudos for their performances and deserve it. But, overall, the journey is disappointing for the audience. We also have a stake in this. I should also mention David Oyelowo as the prosecutor and Albert Brooks as Morales\u2019 attorney and family friend have great scenes in \u201cA Most Violent Year.\u201d There\u2019s no shortage of excellent actors. Writer-director J. C. Chandor shows great promise. It\u2019s only his third feature film. \u201cAll is lost\u201d had pacing problems, but the novelty of Robert Redford as a distressed sailor in a disabled boat adrift hundreds of miles from any port lowered our expectations. It was an experimental film, even. Chandor can continue to sail in his own direction. There will always be an audience. But, the sluggishness of his stories will take him only so far with some of us.

VHip hop fans, at least those who followed US East Coast rapper Biggie Small [aka Christopher Wallace] (Jamal Woolard) rejoice. Biggie gets the big star treatment in this biopic filled with fine actors - and two hours of hip hop. And it's not only the lyrics that are incomprehensible, but much of the dialogue, spoken in the heavily accented black American street language. We can however, make out lots of 'nigger', 'bitch', 'ya know what ahm talkin bout' and of course, 'f**k' and 'muthaf**ker'. Sometimes all these in a single line of dialogue. (Can't really call them sentences.) It wouldn't matter, though, if it communicated.The story is as garbled as the words, made even less clear by the hip hop style of filmmaking. Bling bling, dancing crowds and hip hopping artists (?) are featured - frantically, frequently, fervently.Biggie seems to have found maturity in his mid 20s, and there is little to recommend him as a role model - but this is a different world, and he was apparently influential. At least people listened to his songs (which is more than we can on this soundtrack). Jamal Woolard certainly fits the role for size and is credibly confused as a young man without a father as a male role model - the reason cited for his bad behaviour. Unfaithful, selfish, criminal and unskilled, he presents as a loser trying to prove his worth by succeeding in the world of rap.The film demonstrates how insular this world is, as the East and West coast artists and their fans engage in a deadly civil war - over the geographicality of rap, for pity's sake. The ritualistic behaviour, the jargon of the streets and the incessant posturing of the rapping community gets very tedious. There is little here to attract anyone but the core fan-base.\u000a\u000a\u000a

VThere's nothing subtle or restrained about the themes of The Lives Of Others, as it explores oppression and personal liberty under the Secret Police in 80s East Germany. Yet this heart-jolting film from first time writer/director Florian Henkel von Donnersmarck, is told with sublime subtlety. The politics are complex, but never as complex as the resulting human drama, when fear and betrayal are pitted against goodness and enlightenment. The expression 'the walls have ears' might have originated from these times, when apartments were bugged and lives were squashed in the process.The story about the unexpected humanisation of Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe), a robotic servant of the state, is both devastating and beautiful. Wiesler is as buttoned up as the grey fitted jacket of his uniform, as he eavesdrops and records every intimate detail in the life of urbane, respected playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch). So jaded is Wiesler's view of life, that he is intent to find evidence of Dreyman's subversiveness, and in doing so, score points with his superiors. In particular Culture Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme), who has manipulated Dreyman's talented actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) into a sexual relationship. We hear that writers are engineers of the soul (a quote attributed to Stalin), and as Wiesler listens in to the writer's life, we watch his expressionless face imagining the pictures that accompany the dialogue he hears through headphones. 'They unwrap presents, then presumably have intercourse,' he types matter-of-factly into his concise report.Muhe's performance is outstanding, as he transforms from a shell of a man leading an empty existence to a human being deeply involved in the couples' lives. The pivotal moment for Wiesler comes when he hears Dreyman playing Bach's achingly beautiful 'Sonata for a Good Man' on the piano. 'Can anyone who has truly heard this, be a bad person,' he hears Dreyman ask. As his admiration for Dreyman grows in line with his infatuation with Sieland (both are perfectly cast), the observer becomes a participant, in a remarkable turnaround.Every detail is beautifully captured - the claustrophobic mood, the undercurrent of terror, and the symbolic red ribbon of the hidden typewriter with which Dreyman writes his subversive cover article for the West's Spiegel Magazine. The final reel lunges at the heart and brings not only surprises, but a closing scene that reverberates as one of the most succinctly perfect and profoundly moving. Twisting perspectives on lives, actions and consequences, this magnificent film satisfies on every level.Review by Andrew L. Urban

VThere are more right hand turns than city blocks in the CBD in this exhilarating final chapter of the Bourne trilogy, when a host of different characters become targets and Jason Bourne finds himself with unexpected allies. There's a constant feeling of motion in this highly paced, riveting thriller whose action traverses seven countries, and in which Bourne sets out to unlock the final secrets to his forgotten identity. Action drives the narrative with massive stunts involving cars, motorcycles and a stunning chase sequence over the rooftops of Tangier in Morocco. Gripping from the outset, The Bourne Ultimatum is a thrilling conclusion filled with twists, surprises and a magnetic central performance from Matt Damon, who effortlessly marries his killer instinct with a tangible sense of decency.The story picks up precisely where the last film finishes and director Paul Greengrass once again instigates the frenetic jerky hand-held camera style previously used in The Bourne Supremacy, which positively reinforces the transient mood, although excessively at times. Immediacy can easily develop into confusion when the camera moves so violently that it is hard to determine precisely what is happening. But that small reservation aside, the thrills and excitement are considerable as Bourne follows the trail leading to the top secret Blackbriar project. Meanwhile, the colluding members of the CIA, now headed by David Strathairn's Noah Vosen, are connecting the dots, by impressive use of tracking, bugging and camera devices, following Bourne's every move. Bourne's sixth sense alerts him to the imminent danger and spying eyes, and there's tension mounting when he plants a phone into the pocket of Paddy Considine's investigative journalist Simon Moss in the midst of the overcrowded Waterloo Station, also making him a target.The return of CIA operatives Joan Allen and Julia Stiles is cleverly integrated with flashbacks, shown as blurry memories. Our emotions are put through the ringer as Bourne uses everything at hand to escape from his foes as well as getting his hands dirty to find out what he needs to know. It's a multi-layered, multi-national thriller that delivers on every count, including raising issues of morality, which are at the heart of the film.Review by Andrew L. Urban

VNot since Han Solo and Chewbacca hit the galaxy has there been as much raucous energy and sheer fun as in this blast of a sci-fi fantasy involving a daredevil adventurer and a mysterious orb. In his adaptation of the Marvel adventure, director James Gunn and his co-screenwriter Nicole Perlman has created a stunning reality that is wildly imaginative and intricate in its visuals with generous, broad brush strokes of colour. With its unlikely group of disparate characters all seeking some kind of redemption, this fresh, funny and thrilling adventure has all the ingredients of a huge, big hit. Jump on board - don't miss the journey.The heart rending opening sequence with its huge emotional wallop comes as a big surprise, setting the scene perfectly to introduce us to Chris Pratt's adventurer protagonist Peter Quill, as the story picks up 26 years after his alien abduction. The story begins on Morag, an abandoned planet, where Quill - or Star Lord - as he calls himself, finds the powerful orb at the centre of the tale.  Thrown together by need, each member of the central group plays his and her part, although it is the two digitally assembled characters voiced by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel that steal all the scenes. Cooper voices a trigger-happy racoon whose unlikely companion, a tall, humanoid plant only speaks three words - by the rich, gravelly tones of Vin Diesel. It's not the words, but how he says them that keeps us enthralled and I have to admit, this duo is one of the most endearing of recent cinematic history.Each of the key characters has dimension, beginning with the physical

They\u2019ve upped the stakes here by pairing James Gunn, director of Slither and Super \u2013 neither of which troubled box office bean counters \u2013 with some of Marvel\u2019s craziest characters in the form of Guardians of the Galaxy, and the result is an exciting thrill-ride that strikes a brilliant balance between jaw-dropping space scenes, anarchic wit and bountiful belly laughs. Coming across as perhaps the least shackled by the requirements of a typical origin story of any Marvel film to date, Guardians of the Galaxy quickly dispenses with its dramatic back story right up front, before picking up years later with Peter Quill (the wisecracking Chris Pratt) embarking on a futuristic Indiana Jones-like heist prologue that sets the visually spectacular, quip-heavy tone. From here, Gunn\u2019s universe-building proves assured, quickly rolling out all manner of crazy-coloured, CGI and prosthetic-wearing aliens free of any need to keep things grounded for simple Earthlings. By the time a raccoon and a walking tree turn up and talk to each other it\u2019s just the latest oddity to behold, and the pair become crucial elements of the film\u2019s quintet of heroes (alongside Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista), all of whom boast scene-stealing moments and the charisma to balance Pratt\u2019s star turn. While it may lack a great villain, there\u2019s so much awesomeness going on with Guardians that there\u2019s almost no room for one. I\u2019m gunning for part two.

Or, do you want everyone to come along for the ride? I asked myself those questions and more during a promotional screening of this sure-to-be late summer hit. The answers left me less than impressed. What distinguishes a great adaptation from a mediocre film is its ability to stand apart from the source material. \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d relied too much on the audience already knowing the Marvel mythology. Call it, in my opinion, an unacceptable shorthand. The filmmakers substituted mindless action for a good fleshing-out of the story. \u201cGalaxy\u201d opens with the reasonably touching scene of a boy losing his mother to cancer. The kid has trouble saying goodbye to his mom on her deathbed and instead retreats to his \u201cSony Walkman\u201d mix tape of hits from the 1970\u2019s. Cut to 26 years later and the exploits of a Han Solo/Indiana Jones hybrid out to steal a mysterious orb from an alien planet. We learn very little about the central character, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt). Just go with it, right? He\u2019s a righteous space dude who loves 70\u2019s music. Yeah, that\u2019s it. We also learn precious little about the other characters who unite to become the \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy.\u201d A few lines of dialogue for each principal. Sorry. No time, folks. We have at least a dozen villains you need to meet. The story overflows with characters, all vying for a big onscreen moment. The cast is pretty good, actually. Pratt brings a goofball charm to his Han Solo clone. Zoe Saldana goes from the blue makeup of \u201cAvatar\u201d to the amazingly different green makeup of Gamora. Uh, okay. Dave Bautista wasn\u2019t bad as Drax the Destroyer, a space alien who only understands literal references (similar to Spock in \u201cStar Trek.\u201d) Vin Diesel (box office poison for any movie that doesn\u2019t have the word \u201cfast\u201d in the title) supplies the voice of Groot, a tree-like humanoid. Bradley Cooper provides the comic relief as Rocket, a genetically modified raccoon. The villains are such generic comic-book stereotypes, I won\u2019t even bother mentioning. On the positive side, the film has an above-average sense of humor. The talking raccoon was amusing at times, but annoying at other times. A few of the special effects shots were impressive. But, they often crowded the story. Less is more sometimes. The 3D conversion was also above average. On the negative side, why wasn\u2019t there more of an original score? I realize Quill enjoys his 70\u2019s music. And, personally, it\u2019s my favorite decade. But, it\u2019s lazy to let established pop hits of decades past to stand in for first-rate original music. Music should help tell the story. Established hit singles bring too much baggage. Despite what I might think of the finished product, \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d will be a huge box office hit. And, it will likely break August box office records. As mindless fun, it works.

Which is why uber villain Thanos (an uncredited Josh Brolin) \u000aand his right hand man Ronan (Pace) are so desperate to get their hands \u000aon it. \u000aSo the villains send Gamora (Saldana) to retrieve it from \u000aPeter, little knowing that she has an agenda of her own. And also that \u000athe talking racoon and walking tree are hoping to get in on the act \u000a(it's a bit of a Solo/ Chewbecca double act). \u000aWith the quartet getting into a scrape, and subsequently \u000alocked up in a maximum security prison where they meet Drax the \u000aDestroyer (Bautista), they begin to realise that in order to achieve \u000acommon goals (from getting out of prison to saving the galaxy), they're \u000agoing to need each other. \u000aAnd that's largely the theme of the movie. Against a \u000abackdrop of increasing stupidity (the names of characters and locations \u000agenerally start with the letter Z and sound as though they came from the\u000a imagination of a small child), the character relationships somehow hold\u000a it all together. That and some excellent comic timing. \u000aMuch of the script is dedicated to making the audience \u000alaugh. Tension is largely built up in order to deliver a chuckle, rather\u000a than a scare. With licence to curse and a touch more violence to \u000aproceedings than most of the Avengers can muster, there's an edge to \u000athis one. \u000aChris Pratt does a remarkable job of maintaing the charm \u000aand vulnerability of the lead role, and Saldana also offers her acting \u000achops to make Gomora a believable ass-kicker with far more depth than, \u000asay, Scarlett Johannson's Black Widow.\u000aBut, and this is the major surprise, it's Rocket Racoon \u000aand his muscle man Groot that provide the most fun and even intrigue. \u000aDirector Gunn has a whale of a time dialling up the ridiculous, not \u000aleast with these two CG creations who offer a plethora of options for \u000aset pieces and one liners. \u000aJohn C. Reilly turns up as a prison warden, doing his \u000astandard John C Reilly thing, and there's a certain irony in Glenn Close\u000a looking bewildered by the tone. While she pitches for slapstick \u000asilliness, the rest of the cast play it earnestly enough to make those \u000aone liners, those mumbled, stuttering one liners that have become \u000aAmerican comedy staple, that much more humour. \u000aIt does look like a Satruday morning cartoon. It's \u000apreposterous, ridiculous, bizarre. Whatever. It's not the most \u000aaccessible Marvel outing, and it'll take the fanboys to spread the word;\u000a Guardians of the Galaxy is balls-out fun

With Barry Sonnenfeld at the helm once again, Men in Black III is everything we could hope for and more - frivolous fun with substance and heart.In an eye-catching opening, the film begins with a shapely brunette squeezed into a black leather dress wearing thigh high boots and carrying a pastel pink cake that wobbles suggestively as she walks through the stark corridors of the Lunar Maximum Security Prison. The name Boris is prominently tattooed on her back. By the time we meet Boris (Jemaine Clement), a grotesque one-armed creature with tinted monocles, sawn-off teeth and a deadly spider-like creature that burrows in his hand, we are not surprised when he escapes in a blaze of special effects and descends to earth in search of revenge against K. There is plenty at stake as Boris goes back in time to kill K before he lost his arm 40 years ago and remove the Arcnet that protects the world from aliens.Emma Thompson is a welcome addition as Agent O, whose mysterious relationship with K arouses J's curiosity and there's something reassuring about revisiting the white spacious MiB headquarters, where aliens of every shape and size lurk in every corner.  The scene when J jumps from the top of a skyscraper to time travel to 1969, just before the man-on-the-moon launch, is all at once terrifying and hilarious, while the effects cleverly morph to embrace the era with the clothes, the music and the look.The idea of incorporating time travel into the mix is inspired as is the brilliant casting of Josh Brolin as the young K, who delivers Jones' dry mannerisms and drawl to perfection. There are many highlights, including the divine Andy Warhol party plus extravagant action scenes in the moments before the moon launch. But none of the spectacle is as potent as the scenes between Smith and Jones, when K confides (over pie) that regret is the most destructive force in the universe.

VAt last the humble cow has been recognised for more than simply gracing Gary Larsen cartoons. Udderly delightful, Disney's animated musical adventure Home on the Range is energetic and witty entertainment the whole family will adore. Cows may not usually do much more than stand around and eat, but in this western adventure, they rise to hero status (or should that be heroine?), as they save the day (and the farm).A story of good versus evil and justice prevailing over greed, the filmmakers have fun playing with the classic western genre, where wide open spaces and rich colours saturate the screen.  Dusty browns and earthy colours are married with playful purple, yellows and blues. Using digital and traditional backdrops, the palette is bright, the graphic style is textured. But of course it's the characters that are instrumental in making us care, and the smart voice casting of Roseanne as the bossy, sassy show cow is inspired.The cows with long, curly lashes are a lovable bunch, and as expected there are numerous lines of the milk (sorry, I mean ilk)  'hope it's not one of those fat-free places', 'what's her speciality - sour cream?' and 'there's no use in crying over spilt milk'.

VRichard Linklater's Before Sunrise in 1995 introduces us to Ethan Hawke's Jesse and Julie Delpy's Celine, who meet on a train between Budapest and Vienna.  They start a lengthy conversation that leads to passion and ends on a promise to meet again. Now, nine years later, Jesse and Celine meet again in Before Sunset, when the conversation continues, and memories are rekindled.Shot in real time and unrestricted by the boundaries of plot and structure, Linklater's concept is simple, yet so effective as we essentially become part of Jesse and Celine's conversation.  Contemplative, exuberant, funny, touching and revealing, their conversation is about nothing in particular, yet it is about everything that's important.  From the philosophical to the intimate, the conversation is all about the connection between them.Linklater, Hawke and Delpy have collaborated on the script, resulting in an enthralling snapshot of life from the point of view of two like souls who spark by just being in each other's presence.  They joke and laugh as they reminisce. 'Do I look any different?' Celine asks Jesse in the coffee shop. 'I'd have to see you naked,' he jokes.  We get a sense of being in Paris with them, as they walk to and from the coffee shop, through the gardens, onto a tourist boat on the Seine, in the car and walking to her apartment, talking all the while.  They discuss the pros and cons of ageing, violence, the environment, Buddhism, ghosts, reincarnation, god, song-writing, magic, the universe, chestnuts, love, trust, remembering and personal revelations about sex.  Jesse confesses his superficially perfect life is painfully hollow, while Celine shares her fears of intimacy and her disillusionment of life.  This is one script that does not in any shape or form feel like a script.  It is as though we are eavesdropping, voyeuristic at times.  But always, we feel connected to them, learning more and more about them as each minute goes by. 'Memory is a wonderful thing, if you don't have to deal with the past.'Hawke and Delpy are inspiring in superb naturalistic performances, and there's an especially poignant moment when Delpy sings the song she has written ('A little waltz about a One Night Stand).  The simplicity of the lyrics combined with the catchy variation on three notes allows us to understand how deep are the emotions behind it. (Delpy has written and performs several songs through the film)The Paris bookshop is cosy; the café at the end of the cobbled street has sunshine streaming through the window; the gardens through which they walk are green and beautiful; the trip down the Seine behind Notre Dame is conducive to romance; Celine's apartment exudes a joie de vivre with photos and books everywhere. There is such a strong sense of place as the camera rests on Jesse and Celine as they talk and walk and talk.Our curiosity is fuelled and tension builds as the time draws near for Jesse's plane. Where is the story leading?  Like real life, there are many imponderables, and the 80 minutes we have spent with Jesse and Celine have been unforgettable.\u000a\u000a\u000a

V see it." Andrew L. Urban "A haunting trumpet solo showcased by percussive punctuation moans under images of              a serene tide, gently rippling along a beach, gulls above. The plaintive musical sounds              evolve into choral arrangements with angelic a cappella voices echoing an etherial              quality. And so begins the tumultuous journey of American History X, a mesmerising film              whose topics and themes sear scorchingly through the superficial. Tony Kaye's remarkable              debut film that explores extremism, racism, hatred and the journey to salvation, is an              artistic triumph, marrying contrasting images, textures and sounds to tell a story where              anger is a necessary accessory for survival. Kaye's treatment and superb cinematography              favouring tight and effective close ups, is affecting and powerful. His is a talent to              watch. Images of water droplets from the shower are one moment bullets of doom, and              confetti of hope the next. The script is concise and perceptive, the performances              arresting. Norton and Furlong are both outstanding; Norton radiates rage, power,              conviction and truth in a steely, stalwart performance, while Furlong is haunting as the              impressionable young man who aspires to follow his idolised brother. American History X is              powerful cinema with moody, effective use of black and white photography. We experience              rage at its most violent, and witness the personal tragedy of a family whose life is out              of control. There are some scenes that are frankly hard to take. But through the maze of              ugliness and destruction come some very special moments \u2013 the unusual friendship              between a white and a black man cemented as they fold underwear in prison is wondrous.              Through the harshness, American History X has a poetic element that elevates it to an              extraordinary work with something important to say."

V British mathematician Alan Turing was a hero decades before actor Benedict Cumberbatch was born. But, now Turing\u2019s place in history is elevated by the actor\u2019s amazing performance in \u201cThe Imitation Game.\u201d Turing is cool, because Cumberbatch is cool. The film trumpets Turing\u2019s key role in winning World War II by breaking Nazi Germany\u2019s Enigma code. Millions of lives were saved by Turing and his team of eggheads at Bletchley Park, northwest of London. Not as well served by the film was Turing\u2019s sexuality. He was criminally prosecuted for his admitted homosexuality after the war and chemically castrated, ultimately leading to his suicide. But, the film glosses over his personal preferences and plays up his engagement to Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley). Turing was a troubled soul, but it\u2019s like the filmmakers decided to skip that part in favor of solve, solve, solve\u2026let\u2019s solve the puzzle. Most historians note that Turing and Clarke didn\u2019t have a great love affair. It\u2019s doubtful that Turing woke up one morning, and realized he was gay. The film should have acknowledged his sexuality from the start, rather than relying on hints and whispers. Cumberbatch is NOT one of my favorites. His Sherlock Holmes on television annoys me, and so much praise has been heaped upon the actor that it makes me resent having to watch him in this or that. He\u2019s not even that good-looking, folks. And, his farts do NOT smell like roses. But, with that rant out of my system now, I must say he impresses as Turing. The role seems custom-made. His arrogant, but endearing, style makes Turing\u2019s efforts to break the code as fascinating as an original Sherlock Holmes mystery. And, despite any shortcomings with the historical accuracy, the top-notch screenplay allows Cumberbatch to nail down every last scene. It\u2019s remarkable. \u201cThe Imitation Game\u2019s\u201d supporting cast shines, particularly Charles Dance and Mark Strong. The direction by Norway\u2019s Morten Tyldum is excellent. It\u2019s his first English-language film. If you\u2019ve never seen \u201cHeadhunters,\u201d please do. Tyldum has a nice touch. I look forward to his future films. As for \u201cThe Imitation Game,\u201d you can\u2019t go wrong. A bracing film with excellent production values and a fine cast.

But, the ones coming out of Dreamworks are also obnoxious and headache-producing. The mad pacing in \u201cPenguins of Madagascar\u201d exposes a lack of wit and substance. It is to be endured, not enjoyed. Unless, of course, you are very young. Toddlers to ten. These are the penguins from the \u201cMadagascar\u201d franchise, of course. Skipper (Tom McGrath), Kowalski (Chris Miller), Rico (Conrad Vernon) and Private (Christopher Knights), the rookie. After an opening sequence set in Antarctica, the birds break into Fort Knox to find a vending machine with a discontinued hard-to-find snack. Never mind the gold reserves. Penguins move on their stomachs. After consuming their fill of the cheesy snacks, the quartet is kidnapped by a talking squid known as Dave. Dave despises penguins. They constantly steal the show away from his inkness, getting him kicked out of zoos all over the world. It seems Dave used to be the favorite. I don\u2019t know how that happened since penguins have always been around. What zoo was Dave at, where he was the main attraction? Dave plots to kidnap all zoo penguins and turn them into mutants as revenge for his falling into disfavor. That\u2019s all you need to know, since the story goes at such a furibund pace, there\u2019s little time to absorb plot points. Forget about the story. Just let the kids look at the pretty pictures. What would I have done to make \u201cPenguins of Madagascar\u201d more palatable? Easy. Slow things down and concentrate on the jokes. Use the Marx Brothers as a pattern with Skipper as Groucho, Kowalski as Chico, Rico as Harpo and Private as Zeppo (who knows?) Maybe write Private out of the story. Instead of the usual mad scientist (Dave) routine, find something original and funny to write about. Use some wit and fancy, and stop worrying about ADHD. Today\u2019s children will get it. And, if they don\u2019t, then concentrate on sending films like \u201cPenguins of Madagascar\u201d direct to cable TV or home entertainment venues. Spare the adults.

VPenguins play charades, dress in lederhosen, dance Irish style and wear mermaid suits in this fast moving, high energy, witty and inventive 3d animation whose central plot involving a revenge seeking octopus is couched in themes that reinforce the importance of family. It's a mishmash of ideas, some derivative, while the film plays out like a series of hilarious sketches in different settings, make good use of visual humour plus chuckle-inducing one liners and will thoroughly entertain young and old.The opening Antarctica sequence begs comparison with Happy Feet but after high ones (the penguin equivalent of out high fives) and a fast forward of 10 years, the four zany penguins, including the cute newly hatched baby break into Fort Knox start their adventures in earnest. The incongruous events concerning cheesy dibbles from a vending machine with legs result in a Venice escapade and a face-to-face confrontation with Dave the purple Octopus (voiced by John Malkovich) who has bad teeth and evil intentions. He is also disguised as a genetic scientist. Nicolas Cage them, roars Dave ... (There are also similar William Hurt, Kevin Bacon and Hugh Jackman references.) Enter the North Wind elite undercover task force, a James Bond-esque team led by a wolf who calls himself Agent Classified (marvellously voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) and supported by an explosive expert seal (Ken Jeong), a polar bear (Peter Stomare) and a long lashed pretty owl called Eva (Annet Mahendru).Madcap trips to Rio and Shanghai follow as the penguins set out to save their flesh and feathers, after discovering that Dave has kidnapped hundreds of penguins intending to zap them with his deadly Medusa Serum. Jealousy drives his thirst for revenge; they were more popular than he was at the various zoos around the world where they co-existed. It's the shame the penguins at the heart of the story are not more lovable and charismatic - it's the villainous Octopus and classy Agent Classified that carry the show.

But with his recent releases under Happy Madison Productions, like Jack and Jill and statutory rape comedy That\u2019s My Boy, my seed of respect for the man remains unfertilised. Appropriately, Grown Ups 2 continues that arrested development. Sandler\u2019s \u2018A-squad\u2019 is a comedy file cabinet: Chris Rock tells the race jokes, David Spade gets the redneck gags, Kevin James stops the film five times to do a burp sneeze fart. The talents of Salma Hayek, Maya Rudolph and Maria Bello are ignored as the trio is relegated to \u201cAw\u2026 Honey\u2026\u201d housewife roles. The script contains some decent lines, but the leads dampen the delivery with a noticeable lack of energy. It\u2019s telling when the most charismatic comedic performance comes from Taylor Lautner, who embraces his alpha fraternity douchebag role with some recognisable effort. But the disturbing aspects of Grown Ups 2 are its mild attempts at sentimentality that seek to promote family values. While the film idolises how loved ones come first, it backs that up with Sandler\u2019s character using physical violence as the most appropriate solution in situations that can be easily talked out of. In a comedy full of poorly executed humour, it makes the entire movie valueless.

As the boat lurches Teddy turns green, sickened by the sight of so much water. Thus begins Martin Scorsese's disturbing psychological thriller whose themes canvas a moral fusion of law and order with clinical care. Mystic River author Dennis Lehane's novel explores complex and spine-tingling concepts, made tangible by Laeta Kalogridis's skilful adaptation that lures us into a world where reality is a murky quagmire. It's a breathtaking journey in which we are put through the emotional ringer, while the ever-extraordinary Leonardo DiCaprio once again delivers an unforgettable performance.By the time Teddy and Chuck (Ruffalo, excellent) reach the rugged cliffs and electrified perimeter of the island, the orchestra's horn section is screaming in discordant distress. Mahler is also playing on the gramophone. Could insanity be catching as suggested by Max von Sydow's terrifying Dr Jeremiah Naehring? Is Ben Kingsley's beaming Dr John Cawley hiding something? How did the missing patient (Emily Mortimer) escape? Are secret medical experiments taking place, using insanity as an excuse to find human guinea pigs? And will the violent storm that promises to become a hurricane stop Teddy and Chuck from leaving the island?Scorsese effectively builds layer upon layer of tension, using the eeriness of the setting, the unsettling presence of its deranged prisoner inhabitants and the vulnerability of DiCaprio's Teddy, who cannot stop his own nightmares about his war experiences and the tragic death of the lovely girl wearing the gold locket - his wife (Michelle Williams). The plot is as dizzying and steep as the circular steps that lead us to the top of the island's solitary lighthouse, under which the waves crash upon the desolate rocks. The longer we remain on Shutter Island, the more questions are posed. Ultimately, as the layers are peeled away and the film reaches its gripping and dramatic climax, our vulnerability is as raw as Teddy's in this story of wounded humanity that aspires to nobility. It's a thought provoking film that delves in challenging areas and opens our eyes to horrors that defy the island locations' name.Review by Andrew L. Urban

V He's tall, muscly and looks more like a basketball player than a dancer. Channing Tatum charms the young mostly female target market as the homie rebel with the hip-hop rhythm in this easy-on-the-eye, if predictable romantic comedy. Set in the dance world at a performing arts school for talented, privileged students, the storyline brings elements from Fame, Save The Last Dance and 8 Mile, as talents are pursued, relationships are forged and dreams are realised. Choreographer turned director Anne Fletcher delivers a likeable film with a sweet heart, despite its improbable screenplay that tries hard to mesh together too many sub plots.There's the strained relationship between Tatum's Tyler and his family, plus his friendship with his basketball buddy Mac (Damaine Radcliff) who is constantly sparring with his mischievous young brother Skinny (De'Shawn Washington). Nora (Jenna Dewan), who wears an assortment of fetching rehearsal gear from ripped tights to tiny shorts, flowing dresses and high heels, is having a battle convincing her mother that dancing has any merit. Meanwhile her ambitious, ratbag muso boyfriend Brett (Josh Henderson) discards friends as they outgrow their usefulness. Nora's best friend Lucy (Drew Sidora) is also having boyfriend problems, until she finally notices the admiring glances from Brett's former producer Miles (Mario).Central to the plot is Tyler's realisation that he wants to dance when his 200 hours of community service as janitor opens a window into a world he never knew existed. Nora happens to be looking out of the window when Tyler is making dance moves in the carpark, prancing on and around Mac's car. All that is left is for Nora's rehearsal partner to conveniently sprain his ankle for the inevitable dancing partnership of opposites, where classic dance form and street rhythm make sweet music together.It is a feel good romance and the dance sequences are especially appealing. If you ever thought that dancing was a little sissy, watch Tatum at work, in his overlong jeans, baggy t-shirt and back-to-front cap covering his Number Two hair cut. Rap and hip hop provide a lively musical combo.\u000a\u000a\u000a

His dad, voiced by Albert Brooks, is so concerned his little tadpole will be harmed, he never lets Nemo out of his sight. This, of course, leads to resentment. Nemo strikes out on his own, gets lost and then winds up in the aquarium of an Australian dentist. The story introduces youngsters to the concept of death and rising above one\u2019s disability.

V\u000aWhat a time to go fishing around in Australian waters! Just when a belated inquest is launched into what really happened to Harold Holt, the PM who hasn\u2019t turned up for a single Question Time since he went for a dip off the Mornington Peninsula in 1967. The seas around that southern shore are notoriously hazardous, but no less dangerous than the calmer, eastern coastline if you\u2019re the kind of marine life likely to be filched for display in a dentist\u2019s waiting room tank. That\u2019s the initial fate of the protagonist in this latest PIXAR charmer, and come to think of it I\u2019m pretty sure I read a conspiracy theory suggesting that much the same thing happened to Holt -- Loony Conjecture Volume 101 from memory, falling somewhere between the Martian hypothesis and the unlikely speculation that the poor man simply drowned. \u000a\u000aOf course the magicians at PIXAR aren\u2019t so much concerned with the past as the future. After already dazzling us with computer simulations of light and shape and facial expression, they set themselves a new challenge here by evoking the murky milieu under the sea. They also set a new challenge for Thomas Newman, who unlike cousin Randy (score composer for all four previous PIXAR features) and to a lesser extent brother David (Ice Age; 102 Dalmations; Anastasia), is less known for effervescent, animated orchestrations as for being the broodiest of the Newman brood.  His metier being unsettling, quirky or darkly dramatic soundscapes for films such as American Beauty, The Salton Sea and Road To Perdition. \u000a\u000aWhat we find here isn\u2019t so much Newman changing tack as the filmmakers angling for a soundtrack somewhat more scaly than Randy\u2019s zippy concoctions of swinging brass, swirling strings and melodic winks. The plot might be for the kiddies and the wit and visual wonder for all ages, but the score is strictly for connoisseurs. Forget the junior fish-burger, the forty cues of this soundtrack create nothing less than a freakishly extravagant seafood platter -- the kind which invites you to dive among bizarre shrimp-like crustaceans with monstrous heads bigger than their edible bits to discover confit of Patagonian tooth fish as the piece de resistance. \u000a\u000aOn many soundtracks, a leviathan tally of cues doesn\u2019t really reveal anything. It may merely represent a division of music into manageable fillets. In this case, however, each brief track exists as its own tone poem. Instead of relying on recurring motifs to keep the score together, Newman establishes a sonic texture and then churns out a long series of short musical adventures. The main title Nemo Egg evokes an ocean ambience with piano and strings; around the next corner of coral we find the whacky woodwinds of Field Trip; and as the odyssey continues we encounter the conga, flute and wah-guitar funk of Foolproof; a captivating descending piano figure in Lost; a syncopated, rhythmic pot pourri in Filter Attempt; the delirious kookiness of Fish-O-Rama; a piano frolic funkier than tartar sauce in Curl Away My Son; a couple of jazz capers with stings in their progressions like the tentacles of an oversized jellyfish; and throughout, variegated tinges of exotic scales and indefinable instrument tonalities.\u000a\u000aAt the end of the journey, we end up on an entirely different shore. Beyond The Sea is a terrific old swinger originally made famous by Bobby Darin, and the version here is lifted from Robbie Williams\u2019 2001 release Swing When Your Winning. Beginning smoothly and building to a rollicking big brass sound, it\u2019s a worthy rendition of a great song. Among contempo rockers, Williams has about as much technique and versatility as any, and while he lacks some of the charismatic phrasing of the great swingers and crooners, he certainly doesn\u2019t sound like a popster reaching beyond his range. \u000a\u000aNotwithstanding that vibrant closing number, anyone expecting to be reeled in by Randy Newman-esq hooks might well find this CD disappointing; but his cousin\u2019s score does offer infinite possibilities for those prepared to dive into less familiar waters. Indeed if you\u2019re in the mood it can almost spark the imagination as effectively as a good old fashioned conspiracy theory. Is Nemo really doing time in a mini-aquarium, or is that a red Chinese submarine urchin I detect in the background? \u000a\u000aPublished September 11, 2003\u000a

V'I don't want to be a product of my environment,' says Jack Nicholson's Mafia boss Frank Costello, 'I want my environment to be a product of me.' As the master controlling puppeteer, Nicholson pulls the vulnerable strings of two young men who have chosen different paths. They could be brothers, but they are fundamentally different. Matt Damon's ambitious cop Colin Sullivan has no qualms about playing it rough on the road to achieving medals and glory, while Leonardo DiCaprio's street wise Billy Costigan uses dubious means to effect his honourable principles. The Departed is a tough and gritty crime thriller, tossing up the issue of morality before shooting it down in a cascade of bullets. Based on the 2002 Hong Kong drama Infernal Affairs, Martin Scorsese's film leaves you in no doubt that you have indeed seen a piece of explosive cinema. Deception is the key ingredient for the maze of mind games at the centre of the bloody violence, while the hand picked cast makes it a genuine pleasure.Nicholson fills the screen effortlessly, and we can almost watch him thinking as he evaluates, manipulates and strong-arms every situation. There's a wonderful scene when we see him sitting in the audience watching the opera Lucia di Lammermoor. The wallpaper behind him is blood red as we see his face in close up - the very epitome of evil.Honesty is not synonymous with truth, says Vera Farmiga's police psychiatrist, who suddenly faces her own demons as she becomes involved with both Sullivan and Costigan. Tension builds as both men learn they are facing a snitch  - it is a matter of survival, both physically and mentally.Superb editing allows us to infiltrate both worlds seamlessly and Howard Shore's score shows us yet again this talented composer's versatility. As you would expect, the violence is non-compromising and constantly confronting. But it is the morality that disturbs in the final analysis.Review by Andrew L. Urban

V \u000aIf anyone is qualified to talk about heaven and hell in Hollywood, it's Robert Evans. In this superbly assembled documentary based on his 1994 memoirs, Evans lets it all hang out and the result is the most startlingly candid account of life in Tinseltown ever committed to film. Style and content are dazzlingly mixed in a riveting confessional where we hear but do not see narrator. Sounding like a film noir  gumshoe recalling a bizarre client who's kept him on retainer for the best part of 50 years, Evans dissects the details of his life and career with an irony that never becomes bitter. 'Had it all, lost it all, got some of it back' is how he plays it. That we never see the now 72 year-old Evans only heightens the mystique surrounding his travels through Hollywood from the dying days of the studio system in the late 50s to the drugged-out excesses of the 70s and 80s. The omnipotent aura of his gravely voice has a similar spellbinding effect to that of the Sex Pistols, whose middle-aged faces were blacked-out by Julien Temple in his equally brilliant documentary The Filth and the Fury. The Evans we do see here is revealed in an astonishing display of archive collection and treatment. Ultra-rare footage like the career-saving sales pitch he filmed on 35mm and presented to a hostile Paramount board is worth the ticket price alone. Just as impressive is the technique applied to hundreds of stills and newspaper headlines that fly by. Images separate, pivot in 3-D and travel across screen - making them appear as 'alive' as the moving footage and perfectly complementing the tone of the narration. Evans\u2019 first acting role was playing legendary movie mogul Irving Thalberg in Man Of A Thousand Faces in 1957. This supreme example of documentary illustrates vividly how Evans lived his own version of the mogul's life and has survived to tell the tale. His story would make a great dramatic movie but would it survive the Hollywood filtration process? Probably not - and that makes the real thing even more valuable and\u000aun-missable. \u000a\u000aReview by Andrew L. Urban

VDaniel Day Lewis' Plainview, a man who likes to think of himself as an oil man in a family enterprise is an extraordinary creation. The complexity Lewis instills in this softly spoken man who does not like to explain himself is breathtaking. He takes the character from the epitome of restraint and self-control to a man whose dark side devours him in a gluttonous binge of violence. Based on Upton Sinclair's novel about early 20th century oil men enduring the hardships and challenges of survival in California's barren wastelands, this absorbing film from Paul Thomas Anderson is above all, a fascinating portrait of an enigmatic, unfathomable man. Enthralling and compelling, the film is unexpected, profound and ultimately shattering as it canvasses a man's ruthless ambitions.Anderson's film has the semblance of a saga. When we first meet Plainview, he is a solitary figure doing a solitary job digging for silver and gold in the darkness of an underground mine. We sense his dogged determination as he struggles against the odds. But it is oil that leads him to a direct pathway to success. The opening sequences are strikingly wordless, contrasted by Jonny Greenwood's exceptional music score that becomes one of the film's main characters. It describes the confusion and elation as oil shoots to the night sky; the terror as a young boy loses his hearing and enters into a silent world; the emotional turmoil to meet a brother Plainview did not know he had; a man driven by an unknown force digs a grave in the forest by a small open fire.Jack Fisk's production design is immaculate, while Robert Elswit's striking cinematography captures the barren landscape. The intricacies of the relationships forged by Plainview form the platform by which we get to know him. All the cast is excellent with special mention to youngster Dillon Freasier, who plays Plainview's adopted son H.G. and Paul Dano (famous for Little Miss Sunshine), whose crazed evangelist Eli Sunday is unforgettable. The story twists and turns relentlessly; with each turn we learn more and more about Plainview, a man who settles old scores, sees the worst in people and has no mercy.Review by Andrew L. Urban

V Hollywood breathes a special kind of oxygen, and director David Cronenberg attempts to satirize the goings-on. But, his efforts to mock show business are just so much vinegar and vulgarity. Nothing funny or enlightening in this portrayal of the entertainment industry. Big problem: The film lacks a protagonist. You could argue that limousine driver Jerome Fontana (Robert Pattinson) fits the bill. But, very little of the story bounces off his character. The other roles, Havana Segrand (Julianne Moore), Agatha Weiss (Mia Wasikowska), Dr. Stafford Weiss (John Cusack), Cristina Weiss (Olivia Williams) and Benjie Weiss (Evan Bird) are living too hard in their freaky worlds for anyone to climb into their skins. \u201cMaps to the Stars\u201d is absurdist cinema. Havana is a washed-up actress hoping to get back into the game by starring in a remake of the film that made her late mother famous. She frequently hallucinates a younger version of her mother. Agatha (Wasikowska) becomes Havana\u2019s personal assistant shortly after arriving in L.A.  Agatha knows Carrie Fisher (cameo appearance) through Twitter, and Fisher recommends her to Havana. Dr. Weiss is a celebrity psychologist who gives personal life lessons and training to Havana. Cristina, Stafford\u2019s wife, obsesses over the acting career of her son, Benjie. The teen sensation (Bird) is a horse\u2019s ass in real life. After a stint in rehab, he\u2019s now ready to resume his superstar life in a franchise film series called \u201cBad Babysitter.\u201d Everyone behaves badly. Everyone seems to be in an incestuous relationship, some are quite literally. Despite some fine performances, \u201cMaps to the Stars\u201d fails to entertain or even make sense, at times. It\u2019s more odd than comical. It\u2019s peculiar without being droll. The film needed a satisfactory POV. Instead, there\u2019s only a disconnect with the characters.

VIt's no surprise that were you to peel back the glossy veneer from Hollywood you'd uncover a seething pit of ego-powered corruption, turbo-charged vanity and industrial strength greed.Director David Cronenberg and script writer Bruce Wagner don't so much strip-mine Tinseltown of its rampant avarice and preening narcissism than emotionally frack the place to reveal nary a scintilla of humility or decency.Nobody comes out of this looking good - from Julianne Moore's faded star Havana Segrand bitchily fighting against a youth-obsessed system that's discarded her to homophobic, anti-semitic child celebrity Benjie (Bird) viciously ensuring no-one threatens his top billing.In pimped-up mansions under the blazing Californian sun, this obscenely pampered community never relaxes next to its azure pools but are biliously obsessed with faux status and the accretion of meaningless amounts of wealth.Into their twisted world arrives wide-eyed Agatha (Wasikowska), whose scarred face and arms mark her apart from the flawless bodies of LA's jeunesse dorée but - with the help of limo driver/actor/writer Jerome (Pattinson) - manages to land the job of PA to the terminally insecure Havana.Havana's determined to land the role her (more famous) mother played in a hot new movie but - despite the ministration of Carrie Fisher playing herself - looks set to lose out to a younger model, a state of affairs amplified by hallucinations of her dead mom taunting her.Seeking inner (and outer) peace, she turns to grasping self-help guru Sanford Weiss (Cusack), an oily, Bentley-driving chancer whose own 13-year-old son - the vile Benjie - is terrified that he's being upstaged by a new arrival on his long-running TV movie series Bad Babysitter.In a barely watchable scene, the child star visits a children's hospital where a young cancer patient has to correct his impression she's dying of Aids. She's dying of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. "Can we get her an iPad?" he asks his assistant.Remorseless, relentless and underscored by a pitch black humour , this is an acidic assault on a Hollywood stoned on the self-delusion that it's a hard-working utopia, an altruistic fountain gushing the milk of human kindness.It's not...and lifting the sordid lid on La La Land was never so much fun

Of course the big controversy lies not so much that the violence comprises an abundance of decapitations with gushes of blood, but by the fact that Quentin Tarantino\u2019s much awaited fourth film has been made in two volumes. Surprisingly, even though the narrative relies on the second volume to complete its dramatic arc (unlike other split up films such as The Matrix which are complete within the three acts of each film), Kill Bill never feels as though it is out on a limb (pun intended), but draws us like a magnet as we follow The Bride in her relentless quest to Kill All.

From the exaltation of sublime music from music masters\u000asuch as Schubert, Schumann and Beethoven to the depth of shocking depraved sexual acts,\u000athis is a film of vast contrasts. Definitely not for the faint hearted, the themes range\u000afrom Freudian love/hate relationship, sadomasochism, emotional and physical cruelty and\u000asheer perversity.

A line up that included five notorious crooks who are somewhat suspicious of the fact that the police chose to put them all in a room together.\u000aAs they plan a little revenge on the cops that constantly breathe down their necks, the five villains discover that someone far more worrying than the NYPD is controlling events.\u000aDespite it's modern day setting, The Usual Suspects is very similar to 1940's cinema, from the noir-ish sets to the suspense and plot twists.

p371

V He nails it. Bozeman rises above the material in \u201cGet On Up,\u201d now in its home entertainment release. You may not like the way the story is presented, but you can certainly appreciate the talent involved. The hardest working man in show business lived a complicated life, but that was no reason to make his story hard to follow. The screenplay bounces like a ping-pong ball from childhood to prison to manhood to early showbiz to late showbiz to Brown\u2019s mental problems. It makes you want to scream out for a more linear approach. There\u2019s nothing wrong with flashbacks and flash forwards. Most movies use at least a flashback or two to help tell their stories. But, \u201cGet On Up\u201d turns Brown\u2019s life into popcorn. It\u2019s like catching the kernels as they jump out of the pan. Unless you\u2019re already familiar with the singer\u2019s life, it\u2019s confusing. So many people were a part of this man\u2019s history. It deserved a better telling. So, let\u2019s cover the positive. Boseman. The guy has talent, and it\u2019s on display. He captures Brown from start to finish. From his early convictions that he could be something special to the excesses of super-stardom. Bozeman shows us the doubts, the confidence, the flamboyance, the regrets and the talent (including some amazing dance moves) that made Brown a living legend. The story doesn\u2019t give us much about Brown\u2019s political activism, although it shows him convincing the mayor of Boston that he should allow Brown\u2019s concert to go ahead shortly after the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s assassination. It also shows that very concert getting out of hand and how Brown brought things back under control. The supporting cast in \u201cGet On Up\u201d is excellent, especially a small scene with Brandon Mychal Smith as Little Richard. Now, I\u2019m ready to see Little Richard\u2019s story. Like Boseman, Smith carried the role. You may not like the way the story is presented, but \u201cGet On Up\u201d gives you insights into Brown\u2019s life.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aGet On Up is at once the most unconventional biopic I\u2019ve ever seen, and a shaggy composite of all of them. The only real difference is James Brown \u2013 but what a difference James Brown makes. Chadwick Boseman dazzles as \u201cThe Godfather of Soul\u201d in a performance more Oscar-worthy than Jamie Foxx\u2019s Ray or Will Smith\u2019s Ali. He channels both the great man and the demons that chased Brown straight onto the stage, moving deftly between showman, manipulator and lost soul. Initially Get On Up threatens to be an extended SNL send-up, with an opening scene depicting a confused latter-era Brown holding a room full of seminar attendees to ransom with a shotgun because one of them used his bathroom (a true story by all accounts). Thankfully that\u2019s followed by a more dynamic portrayal of a conflicted and gifted man, punctuated with musical set pieces that are among the best ever created for the screen. It is with the deepest sympathy then that I understand director Tate Taylor\u2019s reluctance to leave anything on the cutting room floor, but at 140 minutes a more judicious edit would have served it well. Stylistically, there are perhaps too many devices \u2013 a broken fourth wall, time-lapse photography, the introduction of chapters with titles, which are presented in a non-linear fashion. With so much going on the pacing loses its rhythm (there\u2019s no funk in the edit, ironically). As a result, a lot of what could have been great comedy dialogue falls flaccid, which is a wasted opportunity when you think of how hilarious Brown was as a public figure (see Eddie Murphy\u2019s Delirious for cliff notes). Great performances are let down by some untidy production but it\u2019s a thrilling ride nonetheless.

VGet On Up comes off like a checklist guide of how not to make a quality biopic.
p377
sg4
V That comes despite the fact that it appears to have all the right ingredients: a director with bona fides in drawing a solid film from society\u2019s racial past (The Help), a lead actor with the chops to handle a major transformation (Chadwick Boseman, who also played baseball\u2019s barrier-breaker Jackie Robinson in the biopic 42), and a producer who was an associate of the figure in question (Mick Jagger). It\u2019s too bad, then, that Get On Up comes off like a checklist guide of how not to make a quality biopic. Here are the lessons for future biopic makers. 1. Don\u2019t ignore the coke addiction and domestic abuse! The Godfather of Soul is a complicated figure\u2014evinced by his many, many nicknames\u2014and it was always going to be nearly impossible to take a man best known for transcending stages and capture his essence between the four sides of a big screen. He cultivated a huge number of backing musicians who went on to be prominent artists; he was a generous and largely kind-hearted man to his friends, family and children; he was a creative genius with a massive ego that was frankly well-earned, helping to birth rap music with his 1969 Funky Drummer being the most sampled beat in hip-hop; he was a racial conciliator who, in one of Get On Up\u2018s finest scenes, arguably prevented Boston from rioting in the immediate wake of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s death. But he was also a brutal tyrant to his band, who rode on a bus as he took a plane, and he fined them for their mistakes, with his points and hand gestures on stage doubling as notation of band error. He regularly used PCP and cocaine, a hard-drug problem that was only passingly alluded to in the film by a single shot of Brown rolling cocaine into a cigarette after a personal tragedy. His relationship with rap was complicated, but not more so than his positions on race: he revered senator Strom Thurmond\u2014who ran for president as a Dixiecrat, to oppose desegregation\u2013saying that he was \u201clike a grandfather.\u201d In the film, racial differences and inequality are largely reduced to punchlines. He was the Hardest Working Man in Show Business. That comes with a price\u2014but so much of the film implies that his life and career was essentially an easy coronation, when the reality was so different. Instead of showing his frustrations with a label who refused to give him any meaningful creative control in the early \u201960s, forcing him into the groundbreaking tactics of starting his own label and distribution firm, Get On Up makes it feel like it was an easy fait accompli that he was able to pull off. He had to push to get heard, push to have his unique sound succeed, and at times push away the people he cared for the most, which can help explain the wild, sad descent of his later years\u2014little of which was represented by the film. And by not doing it, the effect is similar to watching his remarkable performances on YouTube as well as the depressing, rambling, context-free interviews of his later days. Hagiography, for James Brown, actually does the man a disservice. 2. Just tell the bloody story. It\u2019s not nearly as bad as Wired\u2014the gonzo retelling of the life of John Belushi, curiously told through the perspective of Watergate newsman/Belushi biographer Bob Woodward\u2014but Get On Up frames its story by starting with an inexplicable opening scene of him brandishing a shotgun in an office (details largely fictionalized); Boseman\u2019s Brown even breaks the fourth wall at least three times, which is so rarely a good decision. Its back-and-forth travels through all but the last decade of Brown\u2019s life might have worked if it showed something more profound about the machinations of the man. Instead it highlights the movie\u2019s lack of thesis. There is, for instance, a moving scene near the end featuring Brown\u2019s mother, who abandoned him when he was young, but it comes so abruptly that it takes a minute to realize what it is you\u2019re even seeing. And in one of the final scenes, Boseman\u2019s Brown heads for a stage while thinking out loud, \u201cI paid the cost to be the boss,\u201d a classic Brownism. But in the movie, he has paid no cost at all. The better approach: Narrow the focus to hone into one aspect, or a few major moments, of the person\u2019s life. Lincoln, for instance, eschews the retelling of the president\u2019s rise, opting instead to reflect his character through the single storyline of the congressional fight to end slavery. 3. Don\u2019t fall in love with your own star. It may be the biggest saving grace of Get On Up: the fact that Boseman is a more than capable Brown imitator, embodying his tics, his growl, his bouffant hair, that regal chin, his assuredness in his body\u2019s electric motions, his supreme swagger. Without that\u2014and some excellent performances by Nelsan Ellis and Viola Davis, the film would be nearly joyless. But in a way, that\u2019s also its downfall\u2014the film is so clearly in awe of Boseman\u2019s performance that it relies on them at the expense of everything else. It\u2019s an easy mistake to make in a biopic. Consider Jamie Foxx\u2019s role in Ray, Will Smith\u2019s portrayal of Muhammad Ali, or Ben Kingsley\u2019s embodiment of Mahatma Gandhi: modern biopics tend to build out from how well the lead can emulate the title figure, and work from there. It\u2019s usually a good thing (unless they fail: see Colin Farrell in Alexander). But here it just masks the weakness of the underlying film\u2014as Meryl Streep\u2019s Margaret Thatcher did in The Iron Lady. 4. You can\u2019t be everything to everyone\u000aIf Get On Up was made for people who had a serious grounding in funk music, it would mean something that we were seeing portrayals of Pee Wee Ellis and Maceo Parker, who the film largely depicted as self-centred. And if it was, it might not need this end title card that comes up at the film\u2019s conclusion: \u201cJames Brown was considered one of the most popular artists of all time.\u201d Anyone with zero knowledge of James Brown leaves the film without a meaningful sense of just how hard Brown really worked, just how hard it was for Brown to wrest creative control, just how low things got before his late-life renaissance, and just how deeply Brown\u2019s influence is still felt today on pop culture, in the disco, funk and rap genres he helped birth as well as on modern performers\u2019 stagecraft. 5. Don\u2019t put yourself in it, for god\u2019s sake\u000aIt\u2019s always a good idea to have someone who knows the figure to make sure that the facts are mostly right, and the narrative is true to itself. To Mick Jagger\u2019s credit, this film wouldn\u2019t have happened if it wasn\u2019t for his ability to clear the rights, and his experiences playing with and being inspired by Brown come from some authority. But Jagger wasn\u2019t really all that close with Brown. Take his fondest memory from the last time he saw Brown live, from an interview with the Huffington Post: \u201cI saw him at a show in Cleveland. I can\u2019t remember when, but we were both there together. I went to see his show, and he came to see me. We had a good time.\u201d Moving stuff. Nevertheless, there\u2019s a scene in the already-lengthy Get On Up where an actor playing young Jagger nods knowingly at Brown. \u201cI want it to be true to him,\u201d Jagger told USA Today about the film. In this, he certainly failed.

VA lively and upbeat teen comedy that grapples with social dynamics, Mean Girls is fresh, spicy and laden with plenty of tang.  Emmy-winner Tina Fey, who also makes her feature film debut, has adapted Rosalind Wiseman's best-seller, Queen Bees and Wannabes, with a sharp script that crackles with truth and opens wide the treacherous and competitive world of the conniving female.There's plenty of irony as director Mark S. Waters (Freaky Friday) compares the African jungle with life at high school.  As to which is wilder and more primitive - animals fighting for survival or conniving teenage girls scoring points for social acceptance - it is not a hard call to make.  We enter life at North Shore High School from Cady's point of view, and in her eyes, it is easy to interpose imagery of jungle beasts with the seemingly vulgar behaviour of her peers.The shock and horror of discovering the anti-social, snobbish behaviour of her class mates is cushioned when gothic lesbian Janis and 'too gay to function' Damian befriend her, but it never occurs to her that their motives for her to spy on Regina and her clique, may have less than honourable motivations.  The discovery of the Burn Book, which contains bitchy comments about everyone at the school, is a revelation and becomes the crucial piece of evidence that is everyone's undoing.It's a bit like high-school Legally Blonde, as Cady joins Regina's Plastics, and learns that ponytails are only allowed once a week, pink is worn each Wednesday, clothes can't be bought without approval from the girls, and ex-boyfriends are off limits.  Once accepted in the group, it's time for sabotage, and nothing is too tawdry in the pursuit of success.  When your target is like 'the Barbie doll you never had', it's not impossible to convince your prey, who is keen to lose 3 lbs, that a weight-gain energy bar containing 5,000 calories a piece, is actually a calorie eater.It's energetic, funny and the performances are highly entertaining, with Lindsay Lohan displaying plenty of star quality and a contagious likeability. The rest of the cast is excellent, and I especially liked Lizzy Caplan's Janis, whose blatant insecurity about her sexuality is the driving force behind her mission.And just when you think that the film has lost its way and has splattered itself all over the place, along comes the resolution that pulls everything together, reminding us that hurting others doesn't make us feel better about ourselves.  We are the only ones who can control how we feel, and Mean Girls offers a fun trip.\u000a\u000a\u000a

It's a bit like the Wells Fargo stagecoach having a fifth wheel - pretty necessary.\u000a\u000aYet what's gone before shows Tarantino is on a creative streak, able to engage viewers with a sharply honed script while authentically presenting unpleasant episodes from American history

VPuerile humour and slapstick is the language of Adam Sandler's lowbrow comedy in which bad taste, cheap laughs and predictability pass batons. Did you hear about the person who slipped on the banana skin? Well, in this case, it's more about did you see who was slapped by the dehydrated banana. (In case you're interested, it is Rob Schneider.) There's a face falling in a cream cake, an arrow that finds a passing foot, umpteen breast feeding jokes, toupee gags, age jokes and men who look as though they are swallowing flies with mouths ajar watching leggy, shapely babes. Everything is offensive - in an innocent kind of way - and judging by the continual stream of laughter at the screening, there is a market for this asinine film that is basically as harmless as it is moronic.I don't mind lowbrow as long as there is a bit of wit or fun in the proceedings; for my money, there's neither here, but there is no accounting for tastes. The film's main appeal is the obvious camaraderie when you put five real-life friends together on screen and fabricated nonsense that follows. Sandler wrote the script with Saturday Night Live writer Fred Wolf and to be fair, it does look as though everyone is having fun. The pretext of putting together old school buddies with the families they had never met is fine, although director Dennis Dugan (who directed Sandler in You Don't Mess With the Zohan, another underwhelming comedy) lacks finesse. He never manages to set the tone on any level that is credible, which means that there is never anything at stake. The funeral scene in which Rob Schneider sings Ave Maria irreverently during the service is anything but funny.Sandler basically plays himself in the guise of a successful Hollywood agent with a gorgeous, fashion designer wife (Salma Hayek, looking fabulous) and brat kids who have everything, including a Chinese nanny Rita (Di Quon, sweet), who is instructed to say she is an exchange student.  His pals (Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade and Rob Schneider) play his pals and each of their families (or quirks) are milked for all they're worth. Especially James' onscreen wife (Maria Bellow) who is still breast feeding their 4 year old son.I did laugh at Schneider's obvious 'Elvis toupee' flapping in the breeze and his onscreen older wife Gloria (Joyce Van Patten, terrific), who is a bit of a nature-lover. Ebony Jo-Ann as Mama Ronzoni is good value as the larger-than-life black mama about whom bunion jokes and farts fly far more readily than an unfortunate Steve Buscemi, whose screen moments are, well, unfortunate. Chris Rock is thrown away (his pregnant onscreen wife Maya Rudolph gets more comedic opportunities) and David Spade (as the only bachelor) spends the night in a cupboard with an attractive labradoodle that sounds like a turkey. Yes, the film's a turkey, but there is obviously a market for it.\u000aReview by Andrew L. Urban

VI don't need money; give me truth, says Emile Hirsch's Christopher McCandless, as he sets out on his journey of self discovery. The role of the rebellious adventurer intent on doing things his own way is the kind of role Sean Penn might have taken on himself twenty five years ago, but Penn makes his mark this time as screenwriter and director. It's an extraordinary story, made all the more affecting due to it being based on a true story, as described in Jon Krakauer's book. A road movie, buddy movie, coming of age story and portrait of a young man who finds the secret of happiness, Into The Wild is liberating, thought provoking and engaging.From a handful of standard Hollywood roles such as The Girl Next Door, Hirsch embraces this role of a lifetime and displays maturity, charisma and a boyish charm as he goes from spoilt college kid to emaciated naturalist. Armed with the self-anointed name of Alex Supertramp and a grandiose plan to disappear from life's radar and that of the expectations of his bickering, materialistic parents (William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden), Chris trades his financially comfortable life for one that offers him freedom. He simply runs away. 'If you want something in life, reach out and grab it,' he tells Kristen Stewart's free-spirited Tracy, one of the people with whom he connects on his journey. He befriends Vince Vaughn's wheat farmer in South Dakota and hitching on the freeway, he meets long-haired hippies Rainey (Brian Dierker) and Jan (Catherine Keener), with whom he forms a bond. To Jan, Chris is the son she has lost, as he later becomes to Hal Holbrook's elderly widower Ron Franz, which brings some of the film's most moving moments.  But life on the road is filled with challenges, some of them full blown 'tragedies', according to the diary notes that Chris makes.Penn captures Chris' newly discovered joie de vivre as he sneaks on freight trains, rides the rapids and enjoys his solitude in his 'magic bus', his final destination in the wilds of Alaska, where nature never relents. The voice-over reflections by both Chris and his sister Carine (Jena Malone) add great poignancy, while Eddie Vedder's songs inject melancholy and reflection. Beautiful cinematography enhances the stunning locations in this moving and heart-rending tale about a young man who ventures into the wild to find his ultimate freedom.Review by Andrew L. Urban

V Movies great and small for wildly different demographics. But Toy Story 3 and Winter\u2019s Bone  are both tales of characters terrified of losing their home. In Toy Story 3, a band of played-out toys are driven out of the house as \u201ctheir\u201d child heads off to college, and trapped in a daycare gulag. In Winter\u2019s Bone an intrepid teenage girl trying to save the family house from being sold off plunges into an Ozark mountain underworld in search of her bail-jumping dad. Both movies are worth seeing. Toy Story 3 is a solid sequel to a trusty franchise\u2014a 3D  ride to the dark side of toyland, buffered by sentiment. With enough wit to amuse the parents and enough adventure to captivate the kids. It\u2019s had a lot of attention already. So I\u2019m going to reverse the usual protocol and lead with the little movie, Winter\u2019s Bone (which opens in Toronto today, and expands to Vancouver and Montreal next week)  This Sundance award-winner is a superbly acted, beautifully wrought film. Chances are it will be a contender for my Top 10 list by the time winter comes around. Talk about counter-programming. The farthest thing you could imagine from the bright summer midway of Iron Men and A-Team hijinks and Karate Kids, Winter\u2019s Bone is an austere, harrowing suspense story of a hard-headed girl who ventures into an Ozark heart of darkness, a backwoods hell of crystal meth and family menace and unforgiving cruelty. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a powerful, unwavering performance as 17-year-old Ree Dolly, who is trying to track down her father. He put up their house for a bail bond then vanished without a trace. If she can\u2019t find him, she will be homeless, along with the rest of her family. As she heads into woods to question friends and relatives, she runs up against an outlaw code of silence and risks her life with each step that takes her closer to the truth behind her dad\u2019s disappearance. She confronts her ruthless addict uncle, the incongruously nicknamed Teardrop (John Hawkes), and passes through a declension of ever darkening characters. The movie\u2019s desaturated palette is expertly controlled. This is a gray world and we don\u2019t see a glimmer of sun in the sky, or a smile from our resilient heroine, until close to the end. Based on the novel by Daniel Woodrell, the film is set and shot in the mountains of southern Missouri, a world that is captured with stunning authenticity. I was reminded of Canadian director Jennifer Baichwal\u2019s fine documentary, The True Meaning of Pictures: Shelby Adams\u2019 Appalachia. This film portrays mountain culture with the same photographic richness,  avoiding the hillbilly stereotypes, while etching Gothic character portraits of scary potency. And the stark dialogue has an archaic, almost biblical cadence. Director and co-writer Debra Granik, who shot the film in real Ozark family homes, worried about playing into the stereotypes. \u201cMoonshine and meth,\u201d she says, \u201care gasoline on the bonfire of cliches depicting mountain culture. Thirty-five years after Deliverance, even a banjo can still be a loaded symbol. But in our trips down to southern Missouri, banjos kept popping up in the most mysterious and alluring ways. Ultimately the banjo found its way into the film, offering notes of hope and perseverance. I came to think of it as a fresh start for that image.\u201d\u000aAs for Toy Story 3, it does not depart from the safe formula of the previous installments. Don\u2019t expect anything as ingenious as Ratatouille or Up. But the formula works. A few brief observations culled from my recent article on sequels and remakes in the magazine:\u000aEach movie in Disney-Pixar\u2019s Toy Story franchise conforms to a strict narrative template: led by Woody (Tom Hanks), the vintage cowboy doll, a clan of animated toys get separated from their beloved master, Andy, and have to fight their way home. In Toy Story 2, the enemy was a venal collector. In Toy Story 3, Andy is off to college and his toys are once again playing dodgeball with oblivion. Will it be the attic? A yard sale? No, they\u2019re donated to a daycare centre\u2014a prison camp ruled with an iron paw by a strawberry-scented stuffed bear. While the franchise\u2019s sentimental mould is inviolable, this sequel has a darker, more satirical edge. Some of the Orwellian daycare toys are quite scary, like the mad-eyed, cymbal-crashing monkey on surveillance duty, or the big, blank-eyed baby doll. And in an apocalyptic set piece, the toys are sent on a harrowing flume ride through trash shredders to landfill hell. I\u2019m not giving anything away by saying that this Toy Story, like the others, ends happily. Some things will never change.

V\u000aWe\u2019ve long sought ways to heal the emotional scars of terminated relationships. Back in the 12th century Eloisa\u2019s dad didn\u2019t think much of her dalliance with Abelard and whisked her off to a nunnery to get her both away from him and over him; in more recent times girls have cloistered themselves in the bathroom with scents and shampoos and attempted to wash stale relationships right out of their hair; and in the not-to-distant future memory erasing technology might well provide a means for exes of both sexes to scrub each other right out of their minds.\u000a\u000aThis soundtrack is an ode to the mercurial nature of recollection. In the film there is indeed a method of zapping unwanted memories from the brain bank, and the protagonists who were once in love use it to delete each other from their psychological histories. She of her own impetus, and he out of spite. But the latter has mid-procedure misgivings, and much of the film is set inside his mind as he attempts to salvage keepsakes from the mental compartments earmarked for demolition.\u000a\u000aSo off we go on an odyssey down memory lane, with Brion\u2019s impressionistic score helping to evoke the surrealistic qualities of remembering. He is a musician well-suited to the task, being renowned for eclectic performances at LA\u2019s Largo nightclub that incorporate eccentric covers medleys and freewheeling improvisations. Here he offers a succession of pithy cues, economical in both arrangement and length. The first is the Main Theme, a delightful interplay of bass and piano, left to cavort by themselves save for a faint and slightly odd string accompaniment that hovers in the shadows. From there, the mood remains on the money throughout in terms of cinematic context, but the album is a mixed success as music in its own right. Whenever Brion is inventive with chromaticism, rhythm and tonality, the score ignites the imagination; whenever he resorts to bland arpeggios it comes across as whimsical background fare at best. \u000a\u000aThe tracks divide about half-half on that criteria, but there are also a number of songs that add dimensions to the soundtrack. Brion\u2019s own Strings That Tie Me To You and Beck\u2019s triste reinvention of The Korgis\u2019 Everybody\u2019s Gotta Learn Sometime create a sense of pensive melancholy. E.L.O\u2019s Mr. Blue Sky is an ambitious nod to Beatles-esq psychadelia, somewhat lacking at its core as a song but impressive for its dense arrangement; and two trad-style jazz tracks from Don Nelson have so much bounce in their shuffles and twists in their melodies that they are the most easily entertaining tracks on the album. An Indian tune that is used as source music in the movie is performed with remarkable dexterity by vocalist Lata Mangeshkar, while less appealing are a couple of heavier, rather dull numbers by The Willowz. \u000a\u000aThese songs are scattered between Brion\u2019s brusque cues, and the resulting diversity and the fact that the score is replete with the haltering quality of quirky riffs that never quite fulfil their destinies results in a somewhat disorienting listening experience -- which isn\u2019t of course inappropriate. It is difficult to neatly rate or categorise this soundtrack; it is at once as tantalising and frustrating as an elusive memory. \u000a\u000aPublished June 3, 2004

VI relish a good politically charged action thriller (PCAT), and on one level V for Vendetta can claim fame as a non-PC example of a PCAT (central character a terrorist?), but like a black hole, it sucks up anything else in its path, from the Britain of Nineteen Eighty Four to the Nazi Germany of 1930s. The graphic novel on which this is based was apparently triggered by "Margaret Thatcher's ultra conservative government," which was "one of the driving forces behind the fascist police state we created in Vendetta," says its creator David Lloyd. "The destruction of this system was V's primary reason for existence."But the character of V, masked and caped like all good crusaders from Zorro to Batman, is a tantalising presence beyond that. His transfiguration in the fires of an explosion that pulped a lab experimenting with viral weapons is soaked in religious symbolism, and his superhuman prowess shoves this film out of the straight genre. (Yet his home is a tribute to the arts and he listens to music, ranging from Stan Getz to the original, wonderful Julie London version of Cry Me A River. Clearly, this is a man who has taste! If people like this are threatened by their Government ....)Putting questions of genre aside, it is the strength of the storytelling that saves the film, even from a couple of miscalculations, including a twist that I wouldn't reveal, except to say it's to do with the methods that V uses to politicise Evey to the extreme. The other is the ending; I won't go into details of course, but after buying everything else in the film, we're asked to buy into something that seems rather manufactured and contrary to our common sense. That it can survive its own ending is perhaps a fitting element, since surviving our own endings is very much a theme. The endings I refer to here are the revolutions that come at the end of political eras, but which of course mark the beginning of new ones.Natalie Portman delivers an accessible and credible Evey, whose journey we share through every painful moment. Hugo Weaving proves that it's not just knowing the Wachowsky brothers that gets him the gig, playing the character with both his hands tied behind his acting back

V \u201cBoyhood\u201d is the story of a single-parent family, a mother and her two children, made over a 12-year period using the same actors and director. Amazing concept. And, even more amazing that Richard Linklater pulled it off. The Houston filmmaker assembled his cast and crew annually for twelve years to tell the story of a boy growing up in Texas. It begins with the child in first grade and ends with him making new friends in college. In fact, the last few spoken words of this film I will remember for the rest of my life. The cinematic journey is rewarding and markedly profound. As you might expect, \u201cBoyhood\u201d drops in on its characters annually. In 2002, six-year-old Mason Evans, Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) overhears his mother Olivia (Patricia Arquette) arguing with her boyfriend about improving her life. She takes Mason and his older sister, Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) to Houston so she can finish college, get a higher-paying  job and make a better living for her family. The next year Mason\u2019s biological father (Ethan Hawke) drops into their lives after returning to Texas from Alaska. Mason Sr. also has some growing up to do. And, that\u2019s one of the things you like about \u201cBoyhood,\u201d it isn\u2019t just about the boy. All of the characters created by Linklater progress, some faster than others, over the 12-year span. Olivia repeatedly fails in relationships, but she\u2019s learning. Mason\u2019s father matures right in front of your eyes and becomes more responsible. Samantha has a rebellious nature, at times, but is always moving forward. These people may not be exactly like your own family, but you know them nevertheless. The emotions feel very real. Patricia Arquette plays Olivia Evans in \u201cBoyhood,\u201d the story of young man growing up in Texas. On the negative side, Linklater\u2019s film often lacks focus. The scripts were written year-by-year. Very little was determined from the start, just some character traits and the film\u2019s impressive last scene. At times, you feel like you\u2019re on a casual stroll through these people\u2019s lives. The authenticity gets mundane at times. The film\u2019s 2:45 runtime is another negative tick. The mind begins to wander at times. The annual segments needed trimming. Where? How much? If I knew for sure, I would be making films, not commenting on them. The performances are nicely understated. Coltrane\u2019s laid back acting style contributed greatly to the film\u2019s truthfulness. Arquette\u2019s naturalistic approach gave the movie its heart and soul. She repeatedly fails in her personal relationships, but not with her children. They survive because of her soul-searching and good intentions. Overall, a great ensemble. Finally, is \u201cBoyhood\u201d one of the best films of 2014? Certainly, it\u2019s a great film. And, many critics have it at the very top of their lists. Personally, I like Richard Linklater so much that I hope he hasn\u2019t peaked. Maybe \u201cBoyhood\u201d is just a warm-up for something even more remarkable. Something that can be made in considerably less time,  of course.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aBoyhood is a staggering cinematic achievement, all the more so in how readily you\u2019ll lose yourself in this broadly sketched tale of a life rather than pick apart how it has been uniquely assembled. For twelve years Richard Linklater has been shooting episodically, striking gold all over the place in the process \u2013 most notably in the form of Ellar Coltrane, whose lead performance as Mason is what this ambitious project hinges upon. Following Mason from childhood through adolescence, Boyhood doesn\u2019t just capture this young man\u2019s physical and personal growth, but that of the key figures that orbit him: separated parents (Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke); sister (Lorelei Linklater); and first love (Zoe Graham). While Arquette\u2019s performance is a standout, Linklater conjures emotive, naturalistic performances from all his cast, so as the film works its magic and the years pass by, one can\u2019t help but be captivated by the lives unfolding onscreen. That\u2019s all the more impressive with Boyhood, for the most part, avoiding making the obvious dramatic moves we\u2019re conditioned to expect in film. One might anticipate seeing Mason\u2019s emotional highs and lows unfold in traditional fashion, but more often than not these pivotal moments take place offscreen, the audience left to ponder the ripples they leave on Mason and his family across time. That this forward momentum is conveyed more through the years\u2019 contemporary music and the physical changes of Boyhood\u2019s cast is another contributing factor to the film\u2019s unforced feeling as it moves along at a pace of its own. Linklater casts a spell that defies you to not be moved, and captures the incredible complexity, richness and emotion of every one of our unique lives in the process.

VThere is something quite extraordinary about Richard Linklater's film as it depicts a fictional representation about growing up, family, relationships and life's choices - using real time as its bookmark and calling card. It's like being a fly on the wall and watching 'ordinary' life change in front of our eyes as we become involved with the big things and the minutiae in the world involving a young boy and his family. It's the unpredictable everyday aspect about the endlessly changing nature of life that involves us in this voyeuristic and fascinating tour de force, and as a consequence, we have a stake in what happens to the characters that we get to know so intimately over the 12 years it took to make the film.When the film begins, we meet six-year old Mason (Ellar Coltrane), an angelic looking boy with smooth skin and generous lips. He seems ordinary enough with perhaps a little more common sense and artistic flair than most kids his age; he gets into the usual scrapes at school, squabbles with his nine year old sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater), moves to Houston with his mother (Patricia Arquette) and spends every second weekend with his divorced father (Ethan Hawke). Where is life going to take this young man? And what will happen to his family and their relationships?The film's magic is in its seamless transitions through the years. Hawke and Arquette (both superb) anchor the story, and although we watch them age on screen, their physical changes are considerably less than that of Mason and Samantha whose journey takes them from child to adulthood. Of course, much of the film's success depends on Ellar Coltrane, with whom Linklater took a huge leap of faith when he selected him 12 years earlier for the role. He doesn't disappoint. Linklater's daughter Lorelei is also excellent as she develops from an extraverted youngster to an individual teen.Hair styles alert us to time changes - a buzz cut for Mason, red hair for Samantha, short hair for Arquette and facial hair for Hawke. There's domestic violence, cracks in relationships and embarrassing conversations about sex and contraception. There's a boys' camping trip (for father and son), smoking joints, smooching in cars, discovering photography and a pretty girl who makes Mason feel alive. There are disappointments, shocks and surprises and we live through them all. The scene when Arquette contemplates the moment when Mason is about to leave home is one of the most moving - it is one to which many parents will relate as she wonders the essence of that famous Peggy Lee song, 'Is that all there is?'There are a few time markers along the way - the advent of Harry Potter, Facebook, the Twilight books, the US presidential elections - as well as a wonderful collection of music that colours the reality and changes gears as time shifts, setting us in perpetual motion. But most importantly, it is the change that time brings that allows the narrative to flow to its satisfying conclusion. It's a wonderful, groundbreaking extremely personal work filled with truth about the nature of life, the cards with which we are dealt and the choices we make. The way Linklater pulls it all together and makes it work is amazing. The 165 minute running time simply flies. But it doesn't end there - I couldn't stop thinking about the film for days afterwards.

V But some films just may demand that sort of line-in-the-sand passion. Boyhood, the latest from American filmmaker Richard Linklater (Before Sunrise, Bernie, School Of Rock), is one. It\u2019s a film this writer has watched, twice now, largely behind a mist of tears provoked by the film\u2019s grace notes of fuzzy adolescent nostalgia. Plenty has been made of Boyhood\u2019s production. Linklater gathered his cast for a few weeks a year over the course of more than a decade, mapping the adolescence of a Texan boy named Mason Evans Jr. (Ellar Coltrane) in close to real time. The boy\u2019s aging is marked as much by the acne flecking his face as by progressing pop cultural references (Dragonball Z, Harry Potter, Halo) and political movements (Bush\u2019s Fallujah invasion, the Obama-Biden ticket). Imagine Michael Apted\u2019s Up Series (documentaries that catch up with 14 British people every seven years) crossbred with Linklater\u2019s own meandering day-in-the-life surveys (Dazed and Confused, Slacker, the Before trilogy) and you begin to get a sense of the scale of the accomplishment. \u201cBecause it\u2019s such a conceptual effort,\u201d Malcolm Harris writes in the online magazine The New Inquiry, \u201cit seems almost unfair to judge Boyhood as a narrative feature.\u201d But arguing that Boyhood is something other than a conventional movie, discounting it as \u201cconceptual,\u201d glosses over what Linklater has achieved. In a film that moves without contrivance with the young man at its centre, nothing and everything happens. Characters learn lessons and grow up and go camping and shoot guns and fall in and out of love\u2014Patricia Arquette, as Mason and Samantha\u2019s upwardly mobile single mom, cycles through husbands, her desire for security drawing her to a string of abusive drunks. Linklater lets these things happen at the unhurried pace of time itself. He even lets plot threads develop in ellipses, suggesting micro-dramas in the spaces we don\u2019t see, as when a teenage Mason Jr. argues with his dad about his rightful claim to a vintage GTO, promised to him (so he argues) in a scene we never see. In films like School of Rock, Linklater has expressed a rare sensitivity to what one Boyhood character calls the \u201cvoluptuous panic\u201d of youth. Kids are free to drink beer and smoke pot and horse around without the hand of narrative repercussion slamming down. As in Bernie, Slacker and Waking Life, Boyhood empathizes with the oddballs that dot the periphery of a certain American adolescence: the Tourettic loners stalking the suburbs, the conspiracy theorists slumped in the booths of all-night diners, the Bible-thumping backwoods Texans more commonly rendered as no-dimensional caricatures. Watching these characters orbit in and out of one another\u2019s lives gives a sense of actually watching people\u2014not canned archetypes, but fully formed people\u2014get older. Time\u2019s movement over the film establishes an uncommon intimacy with its cast, a sense that we truly know them. It feels like a consummate work for Linklater, who has long been engrossed with the spaces people occupy, how they change over time\u2014whether in the all-night party of Dazed and Confused or the 18 years separating Before Sunrise from Before Midnight. He even has the indolent liquor-store clerk from Dazed reprise his role, suggesting that all his films take place in the same narrative world. This proximity is the core of Boyhood, and it\u2019s more impressive than managing a cast\u2019s schedules for 10-plus years or making nine feature films while shooting it. The gimmick becomes invisible, and Boyhood feels less conceptual than classical: form and narrative in harmony. Rare is a \ufb01lm that\u2019s so bottomless in its generosity and affection.

VIn 2002, Texan director Richard Linklater began filming a small low-budget drama about family life, with seven-year-old Ellar Coltrane at its centre.One year later, he caught up with the now-eight-year film Coltrane, and his on-screen family (Ethan Hawke, Patricia Arquette and Lorelei Linklater). And so it continued, filming every summer, for twelve years.This is Boyhood, a unique and quite wonderful cinematic experiment which somehow manages to capture the intangible essence of life, in all its sound and fury, perhaps better than any film in recent memory.It's hard to overstate how effective this recurring anthology conceit is. Gradually, magically, almost imperceptibly, we watch this little boy grow up right there on the screen - from dewy-eyed innocence to greasy-haired puberty. We marvel with a curious spectatorly pride as he emerges out the other side a man.Cultural milestones help us pinpoint the year - Britney Spears on the radio; Iraq on the news; a new Harry Potter in the bookstands. But this is too personal a story to be some sort of I Love The Noughties nostalgia-fest.You'd be hard pushed to describe a plot.  Mason's mother goes through a couple of destructive marriages; Mason himself embarks on a formative romance.Yet these are not really the narrative centrepieces. Life, such as it is, lobs various obstacles at Mason and his family, and we bear witness to a fascinatingly real and painfully recognisable family portrait.Linklater has previous form here. Dazed & Confused, Slacker, and School of Rock chronicled the teenage experience with keen eye. And his Before Sunrise trilogy established the concept of a loose-'n-easy narrative, in which characters chat without direction (or "profound bitching", as Mason puts it).It's his most sweepingly comprehensive effort to date. It deals in boyhood, yes, but also fatherhood, parenthood, sisterhood, friendship, and beyond. It's messy and unpredictable. It's at once joyous and tragic. It just might be a masterpiece."What's the point?" Mason asks his Dad towards the end of the film, and Dad offers as profound a piece of advice as there ever was.  "I sure as s**t don't know," Dad confesses. "We're all just winging it." That's life in a nutshell - and Boyhood encapsulates it with a rare beauty

VIf you were worried that Bruce Willis at 52 might pass the baton to a younger side-kick in this fourth of the series, think again. If anything, Willis is fitter, leaner and his sardonic humour is better honed, as he brings greater gravitas to FBI agent John McClane, who continues to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. With a concept that matches its budget in terms of size and scale, the threat of virtual terrorism is the focus of Die Hard 4.0, a kick-ass action thriller with electrifying stunts that are as inventive as they are huge.The storyline allows us to believe that anything and everything is possible in this high-tech digital age, when all things can be manipulated at the touch of a keyboard -traffic chaos, biological warfare, financial markets and communication at every level. Highlights include a no-holds barred cat and dog fight between McClane and Maggie Q's high-kicking, sexy voiced Mai as they trade blows in a car suspended precariously in a cavernous lift-shaft, and an eye-popping freeway chase sequence in which concrete roads and overpasses crumble as the massive truck driven by McClane is pursued by a swooping fighter jet with deadly aim. Cars fly into the air and metal crunches as readily as cellophane, and the stakes grow to skyscraper proportions in a naturally constructed crescendo.Justin Long is appealing as the techno-savvy super-hacker Matt Farrell, who inadvertently teams up with McClane ('You're a Timex watch in a digital age,) and I especially liked the scene in which McClane philosophises to Matt about his role as a hero ('Nobody wants to be that guy'). Timothy Olyphant's bad guy Thomas Gabriel has enough clout to make him a formidable adversary and Mary Elizabeth Winstead brings a feisty touch as McClane's daughter. The humour is wry, the action relentless and always at the story's heart, Bruce Willis' McClane remains an ordinary man with vulnerabilities and family values who finds himself in extraordinary situations.Review by Andrew L.

VIt's the unexpected nature of the characters and what happens to them that makes this return to form from the Coen Brothers both intriguing and satisfying. There's bloody violence countered by black humour, and just when you thought you knew what the film was about, you realise it is actually about something else. No two-ways about it, No Country for Old Men is an interesting film. A disillusioned Sheriff, a drug deal gone wrong, a case filled with money, a crazed killer and an opportunist are the key elements of this moody, violent, philosophical and wryly funny film set in a striking, vast Texan & Mexican landscape that shows off a sunset to perfection.'This country's hard on people,' Tommy Lee Jones' cynical Sheriff Ed Tom Bell mumbles through lips that hardly move. It's a character not unlike the one Jones plays in The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, and looks as though he can play in his sleep. Ed faces each day lugging a back-pack of world-weariness, as he waits to see how things play out. Josh Brolin's resourceful opportunist Llewelyn Moss too, is 'just lookin' for what's comin''. It's a good role for Brolin, and he is terrific, constantly thinking on his feet, a stolen briefcase filled with packs of $10,000 under his arm.In small but important roles, Kelly Macdonald does a first-class job as Moss's wife Carla as does Barry Corbin as the wheel-chair bound Ellis. Tension accumulates as Brolin's Moss is chased by the psychopathic killer who poses unexpected riddles, which brings me to Javier Bardem. Bardem, wearing an unflattering mullet hairstyle and a demented, glazed expression, is unforgettable as the 'peculiar man with principles that transcend money'. When asked to describe how dangerous he is, Woody Harrelson's bounty hunter Carson Wells smirks, 'Compared to what... the bubonic plague?'Joel and Ethan Coen's screenplay (from a novel by Cormack McCarthy) gallops along effortlessly and the three sets of sensibilities from the key players blend together like a potent cocktail. Stylistically flawless, the film's richness comes from its characters, each of whom is a pleasure to watch.Review by Andrew L. Urban

VThere is speed, thrills, tension and all the adrenalin that goes with it, but Ron Howard's winning film is not just about Formula One racing. Beyond the screeching tyres, engine roar and deafening rumble is high octane courage and determination. And above all, is the real life rivalry and unique relationship between Austria's Niki Lauda and Britain's James Hunt. The film is one big adrenalin rush and the emotional wallop it delivers is its biggest surprise. You don't have to know anything about racing or be a Formula One fan to experience the whole gamut of emotions in this powerful and highly moving film, whose two champion central performances by Daniel Brühl and Chris Hemsworth appropriately mirror the champions they represent.Howard perfectly captures the essence of the sport complete with the ambience of the lifestyle and the competitive nature of the participants. As we are sucked into its reality, we meet Lauda (Daniel Brühl) and Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), two total opposites, who are both passionate and avid participants in the racing roulette wheel, where the stakes are life and death. Rebel, lunatic, dreamer and desperate to make a mark are some of the ways that Lauda describes the mindset of a racing driver who lives each day as if it were his last.Through Peter Morgan's beautifully constructed screenplay and the leapfrogging that he orchestrates, we get to know both Lauda and Hunt and are there when they meet for the first time at a Formula 3 event. The rivalry is immediate. It is easy to be charmed by the handsome, charming Hemsworth as Hunt, who races with daredevil intensity that matches his off the circuit playboy lifestyle replete with sex, booze and drugs. 'A bomb on wheels,' is how he describes his racing car

V \u000a\u000a\u000aRon Howard\u2019s Rush is an exuberant, diverting dramatisation of the legendary rivalry between Formula One racers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) over the course of the fateful Grand Prix season of 1976. Its combo of hair-raising behind-the-wheel action, heated off-track controversies and stormy relationship soap is hardly earth-shattering stuff, but Howard and writer Peter Morgan (Frost/Nixon) do squeeze sufficient dramatic tension out of the opponents\u2019 wildly different temperaments, while acknowledging their shared sense of purpose and conviction. Hunt is the blonde-and-blue-eyed Brit, a hard-partying, hot-headed playboy with raw driving talent to spare; Lauda, on the other hand, is a brusquely pragmatic Austrian who doesn\u2019t have time for social frivolities, single-mindedly focused on the race to a fault. Hemsworth and Brühl are both terrific, portraying the escalating competitive ribbing between the pair with good humour and genuine passion. Predictably, the women get sidelined: Olivia Wilde is wasted as Hunt\u2019s model girlfriend Suzy Miller, Joséphine de La Baume\u2019s role as Lauda\u2019s wife ultimately reduced a series of wordless glances, which admittedly, she does remarkably well. Technically, Howard doesn\u2019t do anything that John Frankenheimer didn\u2019t already achieve with Grand Prix back in 1966, but some of it sure is dang pretty: armed with Dogme veteran/regular Danny Boyle cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, Rush\u2019s racing sequences are gussied up with expressionistic splashes of hot, saturated colour that heighten the nerve-rattling, feverishly adrenalised view from inside the cockpit.

VThey may both have been vying for pole position but Seventies Formula 1 titans James Hunt and Niki Lauda were (arctic) poles apart.\u000a\u000aThe dashing Brit, the son of a Surrey stockbroker, began his racing career in touring cars and then took the wheel for the maverick Hesketh team, an operation run by a deep-pocketed aristocrat, before tasting international succession with McLaren where he took the chequered flag for the World Drivers' Championships.\u000a\u000aBorn into wealthy Viennese stock, the dour, socially awkward Lauda (Bruhl) defied his parents wishes and launched himself into a racing career, pragmatically securing a bank loan and carefully revving up the racing hierarchy until he was signed by Ferrari and went on win two world championships.\u000a\u000aPitted against each other throughout the 1970s, it was thrillingly obvious that the bon viveur Hunt - mercurial, cocksure, impetuous (not for nothing was he nicknamed 'Hunt the Shunt') - and  Lauda, quiet, calculating, happily married - were on track for a major collision. Literally.\u000a\u000aYet Peter Morgan's script, an object lesson in soberly effective economic writing, lends what could become two rigid stereotypes a pulsing emotional dynamic that Hemsworth and Bruhl flesh out to keenly dramatic effect.\u000a\u000aHemsworth, in particular, is stand-out, perfectly capturing Hunt's sardonically British accent and his expansive - often drink-fuelled - mood swings while Bruhl's Lauda is a model of quietly unwavering ambition and sheer courage after he makes his comeback following the horrific 1976 crash at Germany's notorious Nürburgring circuit.\u000a\u000aOff the track, there's sterling support, particularly from Olivia Wilde as the model who accepts the giddy proposal of marriage from the impulsive Hunt (and ultimately left him for another hellraiser, Richard Burton).\u000a\u000aWhat really distinguishes this already compelling story, however, are the visceral action sequences. Howard films the fiendish clatter of the full-tilt petrol engines with compact digital cameras built into the cars and, rather than relying on CGI, follows real F1 monsters out on the track to provide a jolting surge of power. You can almost smell the petrol fumes.\u000a\u000aThere's been a pretty ignoble tradition of motor-racing movies (Le Mans anyone?) but this scintillatingly bucks that trend, providing spills and thrills as well as a poignant story where even two bitter rivals are obliged to honour a grudging respect for one another,\u000a\u000aHoward, who never takes just foot off the pedal, has made his finest movie

V A robust addition to the street dance sub genre of movies, Step Up 2 The Streets offers plenty of exhilarating routines and a feasible storyline. Andie (Briana Evigan), who has lost her mother (no mention of a dad) is in conflict with her mother's best friend who has promised to look after her. But Andie is not your quiet mouse type of girl, and her street dancing antics are causing a commotion. The crew she is with is talented but on the edge ... Andie must knuckle down. Then she gets into the big daddy of arts schools, a more respectable environment. Her two worlds collide.But the details only matter inasmuch as they provide the springboard for the vast numbers of dance sequences. Street is a subgenre of free form dancing, a kind of gymnastic dance developed and perfected on the streets, obviously by youngsters whose natural milieu is the pavement not the cosy home. The dancing channels energy, whether positive or negative, and encourages creative expression, even for interpersonal conflicts. Better than shooting each other.Briana Evigan and her co-lead Robert Hoffman are entertaining to watch, but a couple of the supports are even more so. Especially notable is Adam G. Sevani as loveable Moose, the unlikely, nerdy looking kid with a great line of comic inventiveness and terrific dance moves. Also outstanding for unique characterisation is Danielle Polanco as Missy, a fiery and endearing young woman with a great smile.Jon Chu directs with all guns blazing, and the film's climactic dance routine is performed in a downpour - which is a risky idea, but Chu makes it work. Although it's not my kind of movie, it has all the elements to appeal to its target audience, who will especially enjoy the opening sequence, when the infamous 401 crew go hell for leather on a subway in a daring thumbing of nose to the square establishment.\u000a\u000a\u000a

V \u000a\u000a\u000aSet to be Wes Anderson\u2019s highest-earning film, The Grand Budapest Hotel follows on the heels of the also successful Moonrise Kingdom in matching his now-familiar odd-bod aesthetic with a mainstream audience. But where Moonrise was awash with wistful nostalgia in its take on adolescence, romance and scouting, Anderson\u2019s latest mines its period setting in service of a broadly comical tale which enjoys frequent diversions into both black and off-colour humour even as a body count amasses and the Second World War threatens to intrude on the borders of the titular hotel\u2019s fictitious homeland. The cast list deceptively points to another sprawling ensemble effort, but despite the bountiful number of familiar faces on display and the amount of wandering in time and aspect ratio the film does, its arguably the most fixed around an individual performance of any Anderson pic since Rushmore. In a rare comic lead performance, Ralph Fiennes throws himself into a character that, thanks to Anderson\u2019s screenplay, frequently offers unexpected laughs. As Mr Gustave \u2013 hotel concierge, elderly guests\u2019 \u201ccompanion\u201d, perfume enthusiast and over-user of the word \u201cdarling\u201d \u2013 Fiennes makes full use of the character\u2019s ambiguity in class, legality, manners and sexuality, aided by whip-smart dialogue and a welcome eagerness to ham things up when required. Unmistakably Anderson in style and tone, complete with some hilarious The Fantastic Mr Fox-sque moments, it\u2019s satisfying to see this level of craftsmanship applied to a film that is often so silly it\u2019s a pure delight to watch.

VBrilliantly conceived and executed, Wes Anderson's Grand Budapest Hotel is dry, droll and delightful. It's a treasure trove of wonders - visually and emotionally - with its stylised, colourful production design, bevy of interesting, quirky characters and top drawer star cast that bewitches at every turn. Inspired by the works of Viennese author and playwright Stefan Zweig, Anderson's screenplay has a constant sense of motion, the action gliding effortlessly from one plot point to the next, as it seduces us into its reality. I sat mesmerised throughout this wonderful, witty film; constantly surprised, uplifted, stimulated and amused. The smile never left my face.Anderson pulls off a major sleight of hand in which he sets in motion the telling of the tale that spans 50 years - from the early 30s to the mid 80s - with Tom Wilkinson's author recounting his experiences at the Grand Budapest Hotel when it had 'descended into shabbiness' after communism. With the role of the younger author played by Jude Law, the scene in which he becomes acquainted with the hotel's mysterious owner Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) in the thermal baths, is unforgettable. Abraham will always be Salieri in my book (in his 1984 Oscar-winning role in Amadeus) and it is a treat to see him on screen in such a meaty role. It is over duck and carefully selected wines that the tantalizing story of how he became the owner is revealed.The time jumps are seamless and as we are transported to 1932, we see the grand, elegant hotel at its prime - with chandeliers, a red-walled lift and matching carpets and whose decadence equates with a fairy-tale Schloss. I love the scene in which Ralph Fiennes' concierge Monsieur Gustave quizzes the young Middle Eastern refugee Zero (Tony Revolori in a career-making performance) as he aspires to be hired as the hotel's Lobby Boy; Zero's name is indicative of the experience, suitability and talents he is perceived not to have.Sporting a dashing moustache and wry wit, Fiennes is extraordinarily good, holding our attention throughout as he carries the weight of the adventures yet to come on his shoulders. Fiennes is at his very best as the suave man who caters to his rich, older, needy, always blonde female clientele, seducing them in the process. His line about having to settle for 'cheaper cuts' after having enjoyed fillet steak (relating to the advancing age of his conquests) is classic. Couched at the heart of the film is the unlikely relationship between Monsieur Gustave and Zero, whose penciled-in moustache gives him an air of the ridiculous.The exposition is fluid, running incredulously (and often ludicrously) from murder mystery with slapstick comedy elements to prison breakout story, all the while retaining an overriding sense of buddy movie tinged with melancholy. The cast is astonishing - at each turn there is another surprise - Jeff Goldblum, Willem Dafoe, Adrien Brody, Léa Sedoux, Saoirse Ronan, Jason Schwartzman, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Mathieu Amalric, Owen Wilson, Bob Balaban and an almost unrecognisable Tilda Swinton as an elderly blond hotel patron with cupid-bow lips and a sense of foreboding.There is so much going on amid the atmosphere of the cobbled streets, funicular and snowy settings that our grey matter is kept on high alert in order to keep abreast of the action with all its absurdities, unexpected turns and serious delights. The mish-mash of accents work surprisingly well and Alexandre Desplat's liquid score is melodic and filled with the whimsy that the film embodies.This is one of the most enjoyable films of the year.

V From the Vietnam pyrotechnics of the school play in Rushmore, to the pup-tent puppy love of Moonrise Kingdom, Anderson gift-wraps his stories as worlds within worlds, homemade pageants of kooky artifice. And he seems blissfully immune to trends. While Hollywood doubles down on the manifest destiny of 3D, Anderson perversely flattens cinematic reality into confectionary dioramas, mille feuille layers of faux naïf make-believe. With every film, the art house becomes his dollhouse. His movies seem to take place in an alternate reality, a world that is as Andersonian as Cronenberg\u2019s is Cronenbergian. It\u2019s an acquired taste, one that I began to un-acquire somewhere between the Gotham bubble of The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) and the Nemo-on-acid odyssey of The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004). By the time an all-too-prescient Owen Wilson popped up as bandaged suicide survivor in the railway escapade of The Darjeeling Limited (2007), I felt Anderson had lost his way. It\u2019s not just that the pick-up-sticks narrative was so archly contrived; it presented such a maze of tones and tangents that it was hard to get grip on the characters, or believe they were anything more than the constructs of an over-active imagination. With the exhilarating romp of The Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009), all of a sudden the director found his groove\u2014by making a cartoon weirdly lifelike, rather than making life weirdly cartoon-like. Then, with Moonrise Kingdom (2012), it all came together. He emerged from a career of smoke and mirrors to craft an off-kilter coming-of-age tale that was unusually grounded. Instead of building the story around adults acting like children, for once he gave us children acting like adults, juvenile eccentrics playing house on a wild frontier. And even though their elopement was acted out in a mock Godard fantasy camp, the narrative framed tender moments of precocious romance with compositions that popped like still-life tableaux. In The Grand Budapest Hotel, Anderson\u2019s eighth feature, the director invests his trademark whimsy with spectacular ambition, and the result is the most richly entertaining film of his career. It\u2019s certainly his most extravagant\u2014in the scale of its cast, its staging and its story. Composed with the cut-gem focus of Moonrise Kingdom and fired with the zany, kinetic spirit of Mr. Fox, The Grand Budapest Hotel can be seen as an organic extension of his previous work. But his universe expands dramatically: the windows of this hotel are thrown wide open onto to a larger world. Saoirse Ronan in \u2018The Grand Budapest Hotel\u2019\u000aThis hyper-stylized caper movie could give Baz Luhrmann a run for his money. It was inspired by Vienna\u2019s Stefan Zweig, a famous writer and dandy from the first half of the 20th century, who counted Freud among his friends, and who, according to biographer George Prochnik, wore alligator shoes, wrote with violet ink and wrote an essay about Handel that he had printed entirely on silk. In his spirit, the movie and its hero\u2014an over-cultured concierge played with breathtaking panache by Ralph Fiennes\u2014are ridiculously ornate. The Grand Budapest Hotel is, of course, not in Budapest. The story is centred in a fictional spa town in a made-up Alpine country called Zubrowka, which seems to float between a distant belle époque and the Nazi and Stalinist scourges of the 1930s. But Zubrowka also recalls any number of imaginary places of cinematic delirium, from the Marx brothers\u2019 Freedonia (Duck Soup) to Guy Maddin\u2019s Mandragora (Twilight of the Ice Nymphs). In its broad hotel corridors, there is even a glimmer of The Shining. And Anderson says he took some cues from the pre-Code comedies of the 1930s. But once again, the world he creates is uniquely his own. Willem Dafoe (left) and Adrian Brody in \u2018The Grand Budapest Hotel\u2019\u000aThe story unfolds as a nested-doll narrative that spans three generations, each framed with its own aspect ratio. We run through a declension of storytellers, from the author (Tom Wilkinson) to the young writer (Jude Law) to a mysterious patron of the hotel named Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), our chief raconteur, who takes us back to the day he was recruited as a hotel lobby boy (Tony Revolori) by the flamboyant Gustave (Fiennes). What triggers the action is the sudden death of an 84-year-old dowager countess named Madame D (Tilda Swinton), one of Gustave\u2019s most cherished paramours in a harem that seems unrestricted by age or gender. The lady leaves him a priceless painting. When Gustave and his lobby boy show up to claim it, they run afoul of Madame D\u2019s son, the villainous Dimitri (Adrian Brody), and the chase is on. This madcap farce ricochets between world wars, and involves 16 characters, almost every one of them played by an A-list actor. They include Bill Murray (desk clerk), Edward Norton (police captain), Harvey Keitel (bald crime boss), Jeff Goldblum (Freud-like lawyer), Saoirse Ronan (Zero\u2019s sweetheart, with a birthmark that looks like a map of Mexico on her cheek), and Willem Dafoe in Gestapo-black leather (a Lurch-like killer with a Luger). Such a thickly populated confection could easily collapse under its weight. But Anderson choreographs the action, and the comedy, with balletic precision, while a kaleidoscopic array of scenic eye candy rolls by. The film\u2019s greatest revelation is Ralph Fiennes. Who knew that the star of The English Patient, who brought such sombre gravitas to so many period pieces, had such a light comic touch? His dialogue is a debonair as his dress, and he lets the pensées slide off his tongue with an air of wry decadence. Lines like: \u201cThere\u2019s no point doing anything in life because it\u2019s all over in the blink of an eye.\u201d Or: \u201cThere are faint glimmers of civilization in this vast slaughterhouse of what was once known as humanity.\u201d Or, even simple commands like \u201cTake your hands off my lobby boy!\u201d\u000aThis actor who once personified fascism to such chilling effect in Schindler\u2019s List, also gets to make fun of Nazis. And it\u2019s comforting to know that Nazis are once again fair game for farce.

It was written by two\u000a      long-standing friends determined, one assumes, in their youthful\u000a      naivete, as their breakthrough in the film business. Passion for\u000a      the material and an understanding of character resulted, some\u000a      years later, in this movie. The two friends, Matt Damon and Ben\u000a      Affleck, are now up-and-coming stars, and Good Will Hunting is\u000a      the toast of the town. It\u2019s a stunning writing debut for\u000a      these two talented artists who have created great characters\u000a      embarking on a soul-searching journey of self-discovery. This is\u000a      a film about second chances, about moving forward with your life\u000a      and finding new meaning in a future not dictated to us by others,\u000a      but by ourselves. In some ways, it\u2019s a story about the\u000a      film\u2019s writers, who have elected to choose a path fraught\u000a      with insecurity, yet the film is unpretentious in its tone and\u000a      style. It\u2019s a simple tale told with insight, intelligence\u000a      and wit, coupled with a degree of emotional richness. Robin\u000a      Williams gives the kind of performance worthy of his talents,\u000a      playing a brilliant psychologist clinging to a tragic past.\u000a      Unlike his over-done, silly performance in Flubber, he has\u000a      created a complex character, vividly communicating the pain of\u000a      this character, as well as his dry sense of humour. Williams is\u000a      superb here, aided by the meticulously controlled work of Damon;\u000a      angry, tormented, funny and intelligent, Damon is hypnotic.\u000a      Playing her first decent character in an American film is\u000a      Britain\u2019s Minnie Driver, beautiful and emotive as the med\u000a      student who falls for Will. Gus van Sant directs the boys\u2019\u000a      screenplay with fluidity and clarity, enhanced by some superb\u000a      music and evocative camerawork. Apart from an overly simplistic\u000a      conclusion, during which all loose ends are too neatly tied up,\u000a      Good Will Hunting is an eloquent and emotional piece of cinema,\u000a      an intelligent piece of story telling."\u000a      Paul Fischer\u000a\u000a

V\u000aOliver Stone\u2019s deeply researched script plays like a Greek tragedy, with the hero coming from the wrong side of the tracks. And staying there. Palpitating with intensity, Scarface is the story of a Cuban rogue whose idea of a land of opportunity in America is a land to be ransacked for his own benefit. But even as he cuts a swathe through the criminal world of Miami and establishes his own form of kingdom, Tony Montana\u2019s character is destined to be his undoing. \u2018The world is yours\u2019 becomes Tony\u2019s ironic mantra, meaning of course that the world is \u2018mine\u2019 - not yours.\u000a\u000aHe is not as smart as he thinks, he is not as indestructible as he wants to be and he never realises that he becomes his own worst enemy. Those who remain loyal to him are finally destroyed with him. This is an epic story because it encompasses the whole damn thing of human aspiration, challenge, determination and success \u2013 and shows it to be empty and futile unless accompanied by something more compassionate and humane. \u000a\u000aAl Pacino creates a feral Tony Montana, and we are attracted to him one minute, repelled the next. Our sympathies sway with his fortunes and his behaviour. He was nominated for a Best Actor in the Golden Globes for it, and in retrospect, it\u2019s an award winning performance, not despite but because of its sustained size and power. Calling his performance over the top is like blaming a tomato for being too red. Whaddaya want?\u000aBut it offended so many it never got a look at the Oscars. Of course, offending people is no bad thing from a creative point of view, as long as you have something valid and truthful to say. \u000a\u000aAnd De Palma does. This is a searing and brutal film about brutal people; that they are Cuban is not an ethnic slur. Albanians can be brutal, too. Besides, they are all brutal, including the Americans and the \u2018international jet set\u2019 types like Paul Shenar\u2019s Sosa. It\u2019s  also the story of one man whose opportunism is equally an indictment of America\u2019s corporate greed, represented by the bank that launders his millions. \u000a\u000aIn 1983, all of this was fresh, from the cocaine to the graphic, high-voltage violence. And it still has that visceral power, even though Tony Montana and the violence have been photocopied dozens of times since.\u000a\u000aNotable as career launchpads for Michelle Pfeiffer and Mary Elizabeth Mastroantonio, it is also a wonderful showcase for F. Murray Abraham in a role that immediately pre-dates his Oscar winning and career defining role as Mozart\u2019s nemesis, Salieri, in Amadeus \u2013 the film he made next (in 1984), after Scarface (1983).\u000a\u000aSeeing the film some 20 years after it was made (digitally remastered with a digital soundtrack) doesn\u2019t diminish its power and its relevance as a study of humanity. Brian De Palma is a controversial director because he tackles those core issues of human frailties head on. His care for the performances, his meticulous attention to the details (like sound, massive teams of sound engineers worked on this) are testament to his cinematic ambitions. He brings all his tricks together to create visceral experiences for the audience, subverting the notions of heroes being good guys. In the end, we no longer sympathise with Tony \u2013 but once upon a time we did. Why was that?\u000a

VWhimsical with dark overtones is the mood of Adam Elliot's first feature, whose curious friendship between unlikely pen-pals is the focus of a humorous and edgy narrative. The characterisations are wonderful and often inspired, yet the structure and development of the relationships feel forced as themes of mental illness, anxiety, obesity, agoraphobia and autism are thrown higgledy piggledy into a chaotic fishbowl rivalling that of the many goldfish (all called Henry), who inevitably meet a tragic end. Elliot has created his rough claymation characters with as much affection as he has bestowed them with flaws.Whether or not the film holds for its 92 minutes is a question in point. As is the issue of Barry Humphrey's narration, albeit excellent, that keeps us at arm's length from the emotional essence of Mary and Max who discover the importance of friendship.There is no doubt, however, that Elliot has created highly detailed and intricate worlds for his two star characters. Mary (voiced by Bethany Whitmore) is a friendless, bespectacled nerdy eight year old girl living in the Australian suburbs with muddy eyes that match her mood ring and the 'poo coloured' ungainly birthmark in the middle of her forehead. Max (voiced by Philip Seymour Hoffman) is an obese, atheist-Jewish New Yorker addicted to chocolate hot-dogs and anxiety attacks. He is also friendless and anti-social, but responds positively when he receives Mary's letter of friendship that arrives unexpectedly one day accompanied by a bar of Cherry Ripe. Elliot portrays their individual worlds in different visual terms. Mary's world is shown in sepia with splashes of red, while Max lives in a sombre world of black, white and grey.The first half of the film is by far the best, when we are introduced to all the wacky characters and the long-distance relationship between Mary and Max is established. I love Mary's sherry-swilling mother Vera (voiced by the fabulous Renée Geyer), who looks a tad like Humphrey's greatest creation Dame Edna, with her streamlined spectacles, pronounced beauty spot, pill-box red lips and black hair tightly wound up in rollers. Damien (voiced by Eric Bana) is the Greek boy next door, who is the object of Mary's affection, but the character does not gel. Toni Collette takes over Mary's voice as she reaches adulthood, and all the voice cast does a great job, especially Hoffman, whose gruff, complex Max, so filled with self-loathing is almost unrecognisable. The narrative struggles to stretch the distance, however, despite the film's many impressive qualities. It's quirky, funny and decidedly black. One thing is for sure. It is not intended for kids, which brings up the question whether or not adult audiences will embrace it, or whether its appeal will be limited to screenings at festivals.Review by Andrew L. Urban

Damien (voiced by Eric Bana) is the Greek boy next door, who is the object of Mary's affection, but the character does not gel. Toni Collette takes over Mary's voice as she reaches adulthood, and all the voice cast does a great job, especially Hoffman, whose gruff, complex Max, so filled with self-loathing is almost unrecognisable. The narrative struggles to stretch the distance, however, despite the film's many impressive qualities. It's quirky, funny and decidedly black. One thing is for sure. It is not intended for kids, which brings up the question whether or not adult audiences will embrace it, or whether its appeal will be limited to screenings at festivals.Review by Andrew L. Urban

V\u000aMore a follow-up than a literal sequel to Fistful of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More keeps many of the same stylistic moves but raises the stakes. Where the original film had a single lone gunman, this one has two, creating many more opportunities for comedy \u2013 it\u2019s the story of a friendship between two men whose mutual respect doesn\u2019t stop them from relentlessly trying to outfox one another. \u000a\u000aPerhaps because Leone felt that the Eastwood myth was established once and for all in the first film, this one really belongs to Lee van Cleef, who gives a lovely performance \u2013 with his air of amused caution, he\u2019s a very human embodiment of ruthlessness, and a nice contrast to Eastwood\u2019s avenging angel (whose motivations here are cryptic, to say the least).

V First, it was nine seasons on CBS with a top rated show about the famed defense attorney. Then, he shuttled over to NBC for a few seasons as Robert Ironside.

Add Barbara Hale as Mason\u2019s executive assistant, Della Street, and you\u2019re in nostalgia heaven. People loved these TV movies, despite the poor to mediocre writing. Who cares if the plotting is a bit obvious and not nearly as accomplished as in the CBS series. This is all about characters you love and seeing them in their twilight years. \u201cPerry Mason Movie Collection, Volume 1\u2033 has the first six TV movies: \u201cPerry Mason Returns,\u201d \u201cThe Case of the Notorious Nun,\u201d \u201cThe Case of the Shooting Star,\u201d \u201cThe Case of the Lost Love,\u201d \u201cThe Case of the Sinister Spirit,\u201d and \u201cThe Case of the Murdered Madam.\u201d  All of them are a bit clunky. The costumes and hairstyles are so eighties. Add some really memorable guest stars along with series regular, private eye Paul Drake, Junior (William Katt) and all is forgiven. The six-movie set is on three discs and it\u2019s priced way, way too high at $58.99. Hopefully, after it\u2019s been out awhile, the price will come down. If it doesn\u2019t, only hardcore Mason fans will pay that kind of money. C\u2019mon. It\u2019s not like these movies aren\u2019t still being shown on television.

Now that I\u2019ve seen the late-arriving sequel, I can\u2019t for the life of me work out why I ever thought it would be a good idea. It\u2019s difficult to identify exactly what this film lacks that its predeccessor possessed \u2013 they both look and sound the same \u2013 but there\u2019s a definite lack of weightiness to the stories, most of which feel like they\u2019re comprised of scenes deleted from the first film for being too boring. The vignette following Joseph Gordon-Levitt\u2019s gambler as he squares off against the great Powers Boothe initially displays potential, but it goes absolutely nowhere. As the titular (sorry) femme fatale, French actress Eva Green has the most fun, just as she did in this year\u2019s other Frank Miller adaptation sequel, 300: Rise of an Empire. What joy there is to be found here generally comes from her. And trying to work out where Mickey Rourke\u2019s make-up ends and Mickey Rourke\u2019s face begins. Sin City\u2018s stylised noir-inflections felt like a breath of fresh air in 2005. The film\u2019s iconic status should remain unvarnished by this underwhelming follow-up.

VRobert Rodriguez, a long time fan of Frank Miller's graphic novels, set out to use digital technology as a means of translating the stark, black and white images of the comic into a movie. But instead of the usual adaptation process, he regarded Miller's work as if they were not only the story boards for the film, but the production design and lighting. And sure enough, Miller's writing - which becomes the dialogue and the narration - is as sardonically pulpish as this noir genre demands. His illustrations are sensationally lit; the starkness of the pared down design thrusts every moment of action into the foreground.The result is a stunning explosion of black and white, with splashes of red. But it's not the blood - although there is some blood that is red - but the odd red dress, the sinful red lipstick ...and the ominous red clouds.The emotional power of the work is enhanced by the visual power, but it really comes from the characters who live in Sin City. Officially, Basin City, but nobody calls it that. These are people who are either already spiritually dead, morally empty self serving and power hungry, like the Cardinal (Rutger Hauer) and the Senator (Powers Boothe) and the Senator's sadistic cannibal son (Elijah Wood). Or the people who are barely hanging on to some shred of their humanity through love, like Marv (Mickey Rourke) and Dwight (Clive Owen) and Hartigan (Bruce Willis).These latter men are all steel, grunt-filled machismo on legs, with a heart we can see and hear; or in the case of Marv, a Chesty Bond figure who takes life's blows on his enormous, gnarled chin (and just about everywhere else).The women are the impossibly curvaceous and beautiful symbols of all that is pure in the world, even though they are either whore or strippers. Hell, this is Sin City, after all. But they are not victims, having struck a deal to run their own street turf. And they police it brutally. As brutally as the men fight for their objectives, usually revenge or greed. Nor is their morality a negative

V Oh, there\u2019s always loads of suspense in his films, but never complacency. That\u2019s what I love about his movies, and \u201cGone Girl\u201d is no exception. \u201cGone Girl\u201d is a psychological thriller based on the best-selling novel by Gillian Flynn, who also wrote the screenplay. It\u2019s the breathtaking story of a husband (Ben Affleck) who\u2019s believed responsible for the kidnapping and presumed death of his wife (Rosamund Pike). Nick Dunne (Affleck) has an abrasive personality. He can be charming when he needs to be, but always seems to be hiding a sly temperament underneath. He\u2019s not always successful disguising his true nature. His wife, Amy (Pike), is a smart and apparently upbeat woman who happily moves to Missouri with her husband, so he can be close to his dying mother. On the couple\u2019s fifth anniversary, Amy disappears from their home after an apparent struggle. Her disappearance becomes a national obsession. She was the inspiration for a series of children\u2019s books written by her father and mother. The story progresses at a speedy clip, despite the film\u2019s 2-and-a-half hour runtime. Fincher, with Flynn\u2019s help, created a complex, logical shocker that leaves you restless, but attentive. Even when you\u2019re given significant pieces of the puzzle and an overall image of it comes into view, it\u2019s anything goes until the end. There\u2019s an answer for everything as well. I can\u2019t remember a single thing that can\u2019t be adequately explained with just a little thought. And, for someone who\u2019s compulsively chained to logic, like myself, that\u2019s important. \u201cGone Girl\u201d has plenty to say about how the media plays a role in celebrated criminal cases. Missi Pyle is Ellen Abbott, a cable TV host based on HLN\u2019s Nancy Grace. And, yes, she is disgusting. It\u2019s a timely commentary on how high-profile crimes often get tried on tabloid television. Not pretty. The casting is pretty much perfect. Affleck is playing a version of himself, or at least how the public and press imagine he might be. Rosamund Pike does an admirable job with her complicated character. I\u2019m not so sure it was Oscar-worthy, but she did get the nomination. And, I\u2019m okay with that. Rest of the cast does a fine job. Tyler Perry was surprisingly aces as Nick\u2019s celebrity attorney. \u201cGone Girl\u201d is yet another awesome accomplishment by one of the best directors working today. The film excites and entertains with an ending that\u2019s surprising to say the least.

V There are very few likeable people in Gone Girl, David Fincher\u2019s film adaptation of Gillian Flynn\u2019s bestselling book, which may explain its critical acclaim. Bad characters are in vogue these days: not as foils to good characters or as animate morality lessons about the dangers of drugs and crime, but as protagonists who finish first, unscathed and unrepentant. From Breaking Bad to The Wolf of Wall Street to House of Cards (the first two episodes of which Fincher directed), moral ambiguity in the movies and on TV is now a mark of sophistication and depth. By these standards, then, Gone Girl is the deepest movie ever made. The film\u2019s protagonist, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), is an aloof, misogynistic hipster (he owns a bar called the Bar) who doesn\u2019t appear remotely distraught when his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike) goes missing on the morning of their fifth wedding anniversary. He is irritated when he finds his front door wide open, his glass coffee table smashed in, and his wife mysteriously absent\u2014but he isn\u2019t scared; a sign in the minds of police and the media that he may be hiding something. Fincher\u2019s film begins as Flynn\u2019s book does, in Nick\u2019s irrefutably creepy voice. He wishes he could open his wife\u2019s \u201cfinely shaped head,\u201d he tells us, and extract some answers to the questions that \u201cstormcloud over every marriage. \u2018What are you thinking? Who are you? What have we done to each other?\u2019 \u201d Amy is a waifish, nagging, spoiled New Yorker, resentful of Nick for moving them from Manhattan to his sleepy Missouri hometown after the recession. We are to believe, based on a sequence of flashbacks and voiceovers reminiscent of Desperate Housewives (these are substitutes for Amy\u2019s diary entries in the book) that Nick and Amy were once in love, but even their tender moments are laced with foreboding. What makes Gone Girl, in its earlier moments, such an engaging mystery is the unreliable narration. In print and on screen, we shift back and forth between Amy and Nick\u2019s voices, equally wary of both but hopeful that their skewed versions of events will give us insight into who they are and potentially, what has become of Amy. Did Nick kill her? Or is he innocent, and simply relieved she is gone? Nick claims Amy is a demanding shrew, and Amy claims Nick is absent and angry, verging on abusive. The competing narration is evidence that marriage is a mystery unto itself, with or without a missing persons case. Unfortunately this is when Flynn, who adapted the screenplay from her book, drops the cheap, anachronistic bomb on us: Amy, it turns out, isn\u2019t merely an unreliable narrator in the same obfuscating fashion as Nick. She is an inadmissible narrator: a comically insane femme fatale whose version of events isn\u2019t sanitized to win us over, but fabricated almost in its entirety to incriminate Nick. She morphs instantly from a real person into a caricature from one of Tyler Perry\u2019s Biblical revenge allegories, a sociopath who makes false rape accusations and penetrates herself with a wine bottle in order to mimic signs of \u201cforced entry.\u201d (Ironically, Perry plays the only likeable character in Gone Girl, hot-shot defence attorney Tanner Bolt). Flynn\u2019s foray into Fatal Attraction territory has caused controversy since the book\u2019s release in 2012. Some critics accused the author, a Missouri native like her protagonist, of being anti-feminist. The limitations of film are especially unkind to Amy\u2019s character, who is \u201cstripped of her self-justification\u201d when adapted to screen, writes Amanda Dobbins in Vulture. Flynn has defended her villainous heroine by lamenting the lack of complex women characters in literature. \u201cIsn\u2019t it time to acknowledge the ugly side?\u201d she writes in an essay on her website. \u201cI\u2019ve grown so weary of the spunky heroines, brave rape victims, soul-searching fashionistas that stock so many books.\u201d\u000aWell, I\u2019ve grown weary of the woman scorned. A heroine willing to set the world on fire to punish her inattentive, philandering husband is a cliché far greater and older than Eat Pray Love. Gone Girl may begin a smart and promising mystery, but it ends a misogynistic wet dream.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aAs a fan of Gillian Flynn\u2019s Gone Girl, the notion of David Fincher bringing her twist-laden, guilt-infused novel to the big screen was a perfect fit. Ditto for Ben Affleck\u2019s casting as the often slimy, only semi-sympathetic and sometimes ill-advisedly smirking Nick Dunne, and Rosamund Pike his missing, put-upon wife Amy. With former Entertainment Weekly TV writer Flynn herself penning the screenplay and the likes of Neil Patrick Harris, Kim Dickens, Patrick Fugit, Tyler Perry and Scoot McNairy popping up amongst the supporting cast, all signs pointed to a quality adaptation and Gone Girl does not disappoint. There\u2019s little room for Fincher-isms here. With a ton of story to get through, his directorial flourishes feel limited to precise, eerie lighting of scenes that are more pacey than he usually delivers \u2013 and for good reason, since Gone Girl feels like it moves along at a clip, yet still clocks in at 2 hours and 29 minutes. It\u2019s the most straight-forward film Fincher\u2019s made since Panic Room, and even that boasted the sort of showiness that\u2019s not on offer here. Instead the director seems content to let the narrative do the work, doing justice to the pulpy story by not getting himself between moviegoers and Affleck\u2019s perfectly-suited performance. Unexpectedly funny at times and happy to linger on its bloodiest moments, Gone Girl is perfectly capable of surprises (including blink-and-you\u2019d-miss-it shots of two leading men\u2019s junk) that punctuate Flynn\u2019s twisted tale with venomous glee. A totally different beast to Fincher\u2019s arguably unnecessary The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, this superior thriller arrives at a time when Hollywood mostly seems to have forgotten how to make \u2018em.

VOnce upon a time Amy and Nick Dunne (Affleck and Pike) were the perfect couple. Both successful writers, they lived the New York high-life from their DINKY brownstone and weren't averse to a quick knee-trembler between the shelves of their local bookstore.Five years on and things aren't looking so good. Both now redundant, they've blown Amy's trust fund on a bar in the Missouri boondocks of Nick's hometown Grand Carthage and they irritably rattle around a clapboard house that is too big for them. Then Amy disappears.Local cop Kim Dickens dutifully investigates and intuits a lack of concern from Nick, a suspicion that soon appears well-founded as forensics turn up a hastily cleaned-up crime scene at the house, a massive credit card splurge on man toys and the suggestion that Amy was fearing for her life.Nick insists he knows nothing...but his smug appearance at a press conference, the ire of local friends of Amy he never knew she had and trial-by-cable-television from a particularly prurient network all work against his protestations even before his infidelity with a young student is revealed. As he readily admits, he's become "the most hated man in America". But is he guilty?Novelist-turned-screenwriter Gillian Flynn hasn't majorly altered the plot of her best-selling novel but she has tightened it up, dispensing minor characters with a dramatic shorthand, while David Fincher is the perfect director to explore the time-shifting complications of the original.Affleck is superb, his nuanced portrayal of a metropolitan alpha male reduced to provincial impotence making him the ideal sucker to play fall guy to the Machiavellian machinations of a good wife turned bad. But, then again, he's exactly the type of man to murderously resent the disappointment of a wife who's bankrolling his latest failure.It's a terrific performance yet the greatest revelation is Bond girl-turned-gone girl Pike - always good for minor roles in Pride & Prejudice and An Education - but here coolly revelling in a multi-layered role that requires both strength and subtlety as what appeared a straightforward police procedural morphs into darker beast altogether.Around them Tyler Perry almost makes you forgive him for his soft soap rom-coms as a media savvy lawyer who's slick championing of Nick's cause nudges along the plot trajectory while his ultra-loyal sister Margo (Carrie Coon) provides a beacon of sanity even as the case against her feckless brother towers over him.It's a mesmerising ride that's confident enough to find room for some welcome gallows humour, particularly after a game-changing switcheroo at the half-way mark which propels the action into a deeper, darker direction completely.The best thriller of the year.

VI love this film. It's one of those films that deserves pride of place in any DVD library and warrants repeated viewing. Frank Darabond's superb script (based on a Stephen King short story) is economical and involving and this, his directing debut, delivers a classic drama about two convicted criminals who forge an unforgettable friendship. It's a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the Pacific Ocean is blue.In the first few scenes, we are given a snapshot of the dire situation in which Tim Robbins' bank Vice President Andy finds himself, when he is convicted of murdering his adulterous wife and her golf-pro lover. We also meet Morgan Freeman's Red, a convicted murderer who has been incarcerated for the past 20 years. Red is a man who can get things (cigarettes, reefer, brandy or pretty much anything anyone wants) and has no illusions about his regularly rejected parole applications ('same old shit; different date'). He is resigned to the never-ending, unbending, cruel prison life under Bob Gunton's bible-loving, callous Warden Norton. The story begins in 1947 but spans many years as Andy finds a niche within the prison walls, making himself useful to the Warden and guards by providing 'sound financial planning' (channelling, filtering and laundering their ill-gotten gains).Freeman's narrative holds the story together and like a skilled conductor, waves a baton to orchestrate our emotions. Red is the only crim who admits to his crime. 'Everyone else is innocent,' they declare with a smile. Baby-faced Robbins is excellent as the softly spoken newcomer with a love for geology and books and who asks for a rock hammer and a poster of Rita Hayworth.  There are many memorable scenes like the one when Andy puts Italian opera onto the turntable and lets the music play all through the prison. It was like some beautiful bird, muses Red. Every last man felt free. Even his punishment in the hole does not dampen his spirits. After all, he had Mozart to keep him company - in his heart and in his head. There's another key scene as Andy and Red sit in the prison yard by a stone wall and dream about a place in Mexico by the Pacific Ocean which has no memory. Full of heart and guaranteed to stick in your memory forever, this is a treasure of a film that everyone should see.The two-disc DVD release includes an audio commentary, storyboards, still gallery, Charlie Rose Show with Frank Darabond and Morgan Freeman, plus a handful of featurettes.Published March 5, 2009\u000a\u000a\u000a

V That\u2019s an understatement. But, you have to admire its power at the box office. Fans of Suzanne Collins\u2019 books are loyal to the films. Attention must be paid. Yet. I continue to have problems with the pompousness of the Capital City and the excessive sentimentality of the freedom fighters. That signals dishonesty. And, \u201cMockingjay\u201d is just loaded with spurious emotions. Part I of \u201cMockingjay\u201d is mostly about war propaganda. The rebels want to win the hearts and minds of the masses as a way to foment revolution. But, the lack of enthusiasm expressed by our heroine, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is meant to endear us to her. But, you can\u2019t BUY her emotions, damn you! She\u2019s the heavyweight hero and can\u2019t be manipulated into false emotions. I found the propaganda storyline quite absurd. And, speaking of silly, did you see Donald Sutherland? He\u2019s still \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d best walking sight gag as President of Panem. I can\u2019t help but laugh out loud, even before he speaks. How are we supposed to be afraid of someone is such a silly fop? And, basically that goes for everyone in the Capital City. Even Everdeen\u2019s true love, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutchinson), looks trifling in his new big-city duds. He\u2019s now the reluctant spokesman for Sutherland\u2019s tyrannical leader. The capital is full of peacocks, and it\u2019s difficult to believe they could be in charge of an entire nation. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman is not well-served in his final performance as Plutarch Heavensbee. He\u2019s supposed to be one of the masterminds of the revolution. Instead he comes off as the blowhard champion of all things Katniss. Isn\u2019t she amazing? Gosh, darn you! The direction by Francis Lawrence (\u201cWater for Elephants\u201d) is overcranked. It\u2019s obvious there wasn\u2019t enough material to make two films and, so, the first is relegated to being a set-up piece. From a marketing standpoint, two parts is pure magic. Everyone pays twice to see a single adaptation. When a box office behemoth is involved, two paid admissions are better than one. \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d are almost over. We are near the end.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aDeparting from the battle royale format of the two previous Hunger Games instalments, Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1 plunges the franchise into deeper terrain. Figuratively, with the pic continuing Katniss Everdeen\u2019s trauma-fuelled mental disintegration and its subject matter becoming bleaker and more violent, as well as the literally underground setting in which much of Mockingjay\u2019s talk of revolution plays out. Against this deep bunker backdrop the cast spend a lot of time sporting unflattering jumpsuits and talking about what is to come in the next chapter, truncated storytelling that hampers this working as a standalone pic. Yes, there is plenty of narrative to work through, and the performances and events that unfold deserve the breathing space that splitting Mockingjay into two films allows. But that makes for all build-up and little payoff, lacking a blockbuster set piece finale (even as it tries to make the most of a rebellion skirmish and an aerial commando raid). Thankfully there\u2019s an emotional climax, a cliffhanger that\u2019s less deflating than that of Catching Fire and will further enthuse the audience to see Part 2 - not that they really need any assistance at this point. Director Francis Lawrence continues his knack for avoiding obvious, emotionally overwrought moments, something he\u2019s aided considerably in by Lawrence\u2019s expectedly excellent performance. The whole franchise has benefited immensely from the inner turmoil she brings to life, and no more so than here. For swathes of the film, Katniss has little to do but react to the actions of others, though she does get to blow stuff up with her bow and enjoy a literal save the cat moment. And until Part 2, that\u2019s the most you\u2019re gonna get.

VCapitalising on the Jennifer Lawrence factor, Part 1 of the final Hunger Games trilogy will please the fans, although there is too much padding around the key thrilling sequence; the film would have been more complete had the two parts of the split finale been merged. Economics no doubt drove the filmmakers in their decision to stretch things out, but like Twilight and Harry Potter, there is a limit to what dramatic impact can be achieved. To the screenwriters' credit, in their adaptation of Suzanne Collins' novel, they have succeeded by leave audiences with a tantalizing cliffhanger ending, although it is a bit of a tease, when there is a long wait before Part 2 hits the screens.After the colour and drama of the first two films, the first half hour of this third is just plain dull as it slowly establishes the new reality of District 13, where Katniss (Lawrence) has been brought following the events of 'Catching Fire'. The setting is drab and grey as we become involved in the movement for change led by the forceful President Coin (Julianne Moore with bad hair) and masterminded by Philip Seymour Hoffman's wonderfully named and well executed Plutarch Heavensbee. Hoffman has always been such a charismatic force onscreen. Things hot up when Katniss agrees to become the face of the cause - or the Mockingjay, 'the best dressed rebel in history' - as she fronts a high profile propaganda campaign for the fight against the Capitol. Plot elements include Katniss' loyalty and stated affection for Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), her relationship with the handsome Gale (Liam Hemsworth) who is still dwelling on their first kiss and her ongoing concern for her young sister Primrose (Willow Shields). Donald Sutherland as the Capitol's totalitarian President Snow continues to be formidable in the role as he instills fear in the residents of the Panem districts, and counters Lawrence's heroic portrayal beautifully. The scene when Snow orders the execution of rebels is chilling and is a tragic reflection of the state of the world today.With Peeta being used as propaganda for the Capitol and Katniss representing the rebels, there is an interesting juxtaposition of conflicting interests. The covert rescue mission is the film's highlight

VThere are prison movies that lean heavily on the hope of redemption, that err on the side of the saccharine. And there are prison movies that hammer home the grimness, that are full of despair and brokenness.\u000aIt's rare that a prison film manages to strike a satisfying balance between the two, but Starred Up just about does it.\u000aEric Love (Jack O'Connell) is transferred from a young offenders' unit to a high security prison due to his uncontrollable violence. By a stroke of wild coincidence, he's put in the same wing as his father Neville (Ben Mendelsohn), a lifelong prisoner he's rarely seen.\u000aEric hasn't been in the wing for a full day before he severely beats a fellow inmate. He's ordered to join a regular group therapy club that deals with anger management.\u000aWe've heard this story before. There's the troubled young man who can't imagine someone being on his side, the distant father whose genuine love for his son is expressed by the need to control him, and the idealistic counselor (Rupert Friend) constantly fighting for the right to help others.\u000aAnd naturally, there's the malevolent governor (Sam Spruell) convinced there's no hope for his prisoners and ruthlessly dedicated to proving himself right.\u000aScreenwriter Jonathan Asser is speaking from experience; he spent years conducting group therapy sessions with gang members. So while the machinations of the guv'nor and his lackeys at times seem unlikely, relationships between the lags themselves are well realised, particularly with Eric and Neville.\u000aThe grand tragedy of them as individuals and as a father and son is their inability to relate to people. Both O'Connell and Mendelsohn turn in finely nuanced performances; despite the brutality both characters exhibit, there's never any doubt of their frailty.\u000aIn particular, Neville's realisation of his own flaws and the impact they have on Eric is heartstopping in its simple, inelegant honesty.\u000aAlthough the unwieldy structure sometimes gets in the way, and although some of the supporting characters seem hackneyed and unrealistic, Starred Up packs a potent emotional punch.\u000aIt's a story of the broken that doesn't attempt to heal them completely, but rather suggests that healing is possible - one day. And it's all the more powerful for it

Drama, horror-fest, romance, spy thriller and comedy with tinges of slapstick are lovingly and theatrically style-slapped into shape by the fearless Tarantino, whose child-like enthusiasm infused with graphic violence, is easily imagined. It could be considered a conceit of the largest proportions to suggest that cinema per se could destroy Hitler and the SS, but Tarantino's vision is gallant and brilliant.Language is also a hybrid with subtitles translating the mainstay of German and French spoken.

Aldo heads up the Basterds, an intrepid Nazi hunter who demands Nazi scalps (literally) from his followers. Structured into five chapters, the story begins in 1941 on a dairy farm in Nazi-occupied France and takes us on a journey in which we meet a German Officer turned actor (Daniel Brühl), who believes he is more than his uniform, a cinema owner (Mélanie Laurent, reminiscent of Uma Thurman) intent on revenge, a German actress with a secret affiliation (Diane Kruger), Til Schweiger as the feared Nazi-killer and Michael Fassbender as a former film critic.

V \u000aIn 1968, when Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey was released, on 70 mm and in a 2.21:1 aspect ratio, it would be another year before Apollo 11 landed on the moon. That spectacle was small-screen\u2014broadcast live, in grainy black-and-white to TVs back on Earth, Neil Armstrong took \u201cone giant leap for mankind,\u201d ending the Space Race. But by 1979, the $500-million-plus grossed planet-wide for George Lucas\u2019 $11-million space opera signalled the launch of Hollywood\u2019s Blockbuster Race. Ever since, we\u2019ve had soaring, FX-engineered spectacles on NASA-level budgets taking us far, far away. These unearthly epics, charting a meteoric course to the top of the box office, are fitted with marketing rocket-boosters, piloted by A-list stars, and boast more of a stratospheric emotional arc than any space agency\u2019s plotted in decades. For a super-sized-movie\u2019s director, it\u2019s all about mission control. Christopher Nolan, who in 1998 made his feature debut with black-and-white neo-noir Following (budget: $6000), has become a go-to populist auteur for blockbusters. He\u2019s earned such a banked-on reputation for delivering huge films under budget that, in an unprecedented deal, Warner Bros traded rights to two franchises and a property to-be-determined to Paramount (the project\u2019s initiator and owners of the script, by Nolan\u2019s brother Jonathan) to secure international distribution for Interstellar (budget: $165 million). But Nolan\u2019s 2001 for 2014 lacks story control. From its earworm-hole of a score (in climactic moments, Hans Zimmer\u2019s music even overwhelms the dialogue) to its warped drive through plots\u2014secret hideout-discovery, code breaking, father-daughter drama, traitor-among-us suspense, sci-fi salvation\u2014Interstellar is a bombast-and-crisis megamovie, rocket-fuelled by gobbledygeek. The dominant force here is love\u2014a re-romanticization of NASA, then a stars-spanning swoon into the notion that love\u2019s a human force as great as gravity. Seriously. (The great threat isn\u2019t machine, as in 2001, but isolated, loveless man.) Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), once a shuttle pilot, lives in a farmhouse with daughter Murphy and son Tom; the Earth\u2019s plagued by dust storms and blight. Cooper\u2019s drawn back to NASA (don\u2019t ask), where Dr Brand (Michael Caine) wants him to fly through a wormhole to a system with planets that may prove inhabitable. The mission dwindles quickly from exploration into survival (it makes Gravity\u2018s obstacle-course seem banally believable). Cooper remains a cerebral super-man throughout, an ever-staunch starfighter coming up with brilliant, humanity-saving ideas in no time; colleague Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) mostly shoulders blame and harbours a secret love. There is a brilliant sequence imagining time and memory as its own dimension\u2014a colour-and-light-striated infinite hall of bookcases. Grainy video-feeds of Murphy, all grown up (Jessica Chastain) and talking to Cooper from years away (because of relativity and blahblackholeblah) are deeply moving. But the pummelling of plot turns and ratcheting of emotion-wrenches rarely relent; a flurry of crises melts into a wash of ideas about space-time that would have even Dr Who over his head. Less propaganda for space-flight than flashy, overstuffed advertising for the dimension-smashing abilities of blockbuster-moviemaking itself\u2014watch as heart and mind, space and time, past and present, are rolled into one incandescent ball of supernova sensation there on the event-horizon!\u2014Interstellar, arcing on and on and on for 165 minutes, forgets that we mere humans don\u2019t yet possess infinite patience for hyper-epic hokum.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aNever has a nearly-three-hour blockbuster enthralled me in the way that Interstellar did. After the grim seriousness and plodding pacing of his Dark Knight films, where Christopher Nolan did his damnedest to provide a real world for an utterly ridiculous character to play in, it\u2019s a relief to see him freed from such constraints. Not that there isn\u2019t solid science underpinning Interstellar\u2019s world-building (and departing), in fact there\u2019s a ton of it. Those not interested in cosmological hows and whys may find the necessary infodumps all too frequent, but where Interstellar eclipses Nolan\u2019s creativity as seen onscreen previously is in the sense of awe, wonder and spectacle he\u2019s able to conjure on this trip into the unknown. That the film veers all over the place is, to me, one of the things that justifies its length. Giving himself more of that precious resource, time, to play with (and jettisoning the expected training montage second act), Nolan gets to introduce A-list actors late, indulge in sub-plots that don\u2019t emerge until the final half hour, and take us to some truly spectacular places along the way. The cast are good, if not outright great. As with other Nolan pics, his ability to construct strong characters powered by real emotion is lacking. Luckily the likes of McConaughey, Chastain, Caine and even Hathaway (mostly) bring plenty to their performances. Perhaps this is all sounding ho hum to you. But if space travel, sci-fi and visual spectacle appeal, you can\u2019t look past this triumph of the imagination where the wondrous universe is the true star. Interstellar renders this semi-palatable for mainstream consumption thanks to co-writers Jonathan Nolan and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne. Add a director who may not have the singularity of vision possessed by Kubrick (himself flawed), and you\u2019ve still got one of the most watchable self-indulgent projects in ages.

V \u201cInterstellar\u201d almost makes it. But, the science fiction adventure film has problems after take-off. \u201cInterstellar\u201d is a flawed but fascinating journey featuring plot elements that seem more Spielbergian than Nolanesque. And, an outrageously unbalanced sound design becomes a major distraction late in the film. More on that, later. A memorable sci-fi has to be more than just special effects. The story needs to equal all the razzle-dazzle. \u201cInterstellar\u201d feels like someone else\u2019s film, a Spielberg retread. The story opens with a widower (Matthew McConaughey) trying to keep his family unit functioning while the world literally crumbles into dust clouds. Earth needs food to feed its seven billion residents. And, that means family farms are of the utmost importance. Former engineer/astronaut Cooper (McConaughey) lives in a low-tech world that doesn\u2019t need space travel anymore. Technology is on the fritz. So, Cooper manages the family farm with his father-in-law (John Lithgow) and his two children, Murph and Tom. After a strange gravitational event in his daughter\u2019s bedroom, Cooper and Murph (Mackenzie Foy) hit the road to find a secret NASA operation planning an intergalactic mission. It\u2019s no surprise that Steven Spielberg was interested in this project, since it reportedly was written for him. And, the first 45 minutes is basically \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\u201d minus the giant mound of mashed potatoes. Co-screenwriter Jonathan Nolan (Christopher\u2019s brother) likely added the family/unearthly message elements as a way to attract and/or appease Spielberg. So, when Christopher Nolan took over as director, the Spielberg elements needed to go. It\u2019s not his movie anymore. Nolan would be better served with a complete rewrite. When Cooper agrees to pilot a spaceship through a wormhole in a frantic effort to find a new habitable planet, that\u2019s when the story gets interesting. At the secret NASA operation, he meets his old professor (Michael Caine), the man with most of the answers. The crew of the Endurance includes the professor\u2019s daughter, Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway). Rest of the story I will leave to you. Because, despite my complaints, I don\u2019t want to keep you from seeing this film or ruin the discovery process. Keep in mind, Nolan\u2019s worst film is better than most of the crap coming out of Hollywood these days. Nolan used IMAX cameras for much of this production, and it shows. The photography is spectacular. The special effects are awesome. So, what happened with Zimmer\u2019s score? It was overpowering in key scenes. I couldn\u2019t understand the dialogue. You could hear the characters speaking, but you could NOT comprehend what they were saying. Nolan says he planned it that way. Hard to believe, unless he\u2019s gone nuts. The acting in this space saga is quite excellent. Especially, McConaughey. He is the perfect everyman to go on this adventure. Any praise he gets for this film is well-deserved. Finally, the running time is 169 minutes. That\u2019s over three hours, folks. The story would have been better served with more specifics on why the earth was becoming uninhabitable. The takeaway from \u201cInterstellar\u201d is that Christopher Nolan is human after all. It\u2019s a trip marred by sound distortion, but still worthwhile.

VAn astonishing performance by young Thomas Doret as Cyril delivers the core of this well crafted, subtle yet powerful screenplay, which has won several accolades for the Dardennes brothers, starting with the film winning the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes (2011). Doret's performance brings to mind the young Jean-Pierre Leaud as Antoine Doinel in Francois Truffaut's 1959 classic, The 400 Blows, a character not unlike Cyril in some respects.The film belongs to Doret, as we see Cyril struggling to cope with the emotional and to a lesser extent physical discomforts of being abandoned by his father (Jeremy Renier). Cyril, about 11, is already motherless, although we never hear about her or why she is absent. A feisty, determined kid, he runs away from the state institution to try and find his father - and then his push bike. The former shuns him, the latter is stolen from him.At his most vulnerable, Cyril finds and angel in the form of humble hairdresser Samantha (Cecile De France), who agrees to his request to spend weekends with her. But his inner pain bursts out and he's too hard to handle. She fears his association with a local tough guy, Wes (Egon Di Mateo) will prove disastrous - which it does. Di Mateo is terrific.The Dardennes avoid making the film sentimental and sidestep every cliché that beckons. Subtly, they nurse the story along without the heavy handed intervention that fiction sometimes urges, and allow us to gain some understanding into Cyril's inner self. Samantha's reasons for accepting the task of part time foster mother aren't articulated either; she shrugs when he asks. But in her actions it's easy to see the real reasons

VA harmless teen comedy with more enthusiasm than cinematic merit, Fired Up! combines silliness, low-brow humour, romance and cheerleading acrobatics in its formulaic and predictable arsenal. Cheerleading is so specific to the American culture, that for us, it is almost a curiosity to watch two skirt-chasing lotharios jump onboard the bus to Cheer Camp, where 300 'hotties' await conquest. Their motto to leave no girl left unturned might be their driving force, but like cheerleading, things go up and down with bumps in between. Firing up precisely what it promises, the film might be limited in its appeal, but it's energetic with a few laughs as it dishes out silly fun for its young target market.First up, we meet Nicholas D'Agosto's Shawn Colfax and Eric Christian Olsen's Nick Brady. They're a hapless duo whose decision to trade football camp for Cheer Camp is totally self serving. D'Agosto, with his mop of black tousled hair has appeal as the more sensitive of the two, while Colfax's Nick is totally shallow and overbearing ('We're athletes, we can do anything'). The film tracks their experiences at Camp, when Shawn falls for Cheerleader Captain Carly (Sarah Roemer), whose creepy intern medico boyfriend (David Walton) is a sleazy caricature.

VA harmless teen comedy with more enthusiasm than cinematic merit, Fired Up! combines silliness, low-brow humour, romance and cheerleading acrobatics in its formulaic and predictable arsenal. Cheerleading is so specific to the American culture, that for us, it is almost a curiosity to watch two skirt-chasing lotharios jump onboard the bus to Cheer Camp, where 300 'hotties' await conquest. Their motto to leave no girl left unturned might be their driving force, but like cheerleading, things go up and down with bumps in between. Firing up precisely what it promises, the film might be limited in its appeal, but it's energetic with a few laughs as it dishes out silly fun for its young target market.First up, we meet Nicholas D'Agosto's Shawn Colfax and Eric Christian Olsen's Nick Brady. They're a hapless duo whose decision to trade football camp for Cheer Camp is totally self serving. D'Agosto, with his mop of black tousled hair has appeal as the more sensitive of the two, while Colfax's Nick is totally shallow and overbearing ('We're athletes, we can do anything'). The film tracks their experiences at Camp, when Shawn falls for Cheerleader Captain Carly (Sarah Roemer), whose creepy intern medico boyfriend (David Walton) is a sleazy caricature. There's a scene involving a naked Shawn and Nick positioning their pom poms in strategic places and although the humour is low-key, there is little to offend.Perhaps the funniest scenes are ones that promote chuckles rather than laughs. Like the scene in the bus when the girls all chant together phrases like 'We are driving' as if it were a routine, and there's something nonsensical when the entire camp watches the movie Bring It On as if it were their mantra, mouthing the dialogue word perfect.

V\u000aBased on a book of short stories, Personal Velocity is a trilogy about three women who have each reached a critical point in their lives and are intent on changing their circumstance. They are not connected in any way, except for a common breaking news story that is flashed on the television and whose relevance becomes apparent in the third story.  Rebecca Miller\u2019s script and film envelops us in the lives of these three women, who are each brought to life by three highly talented actresses. This is a low-budget film shot on video and whose DOGME-like camera work brings immediacy to the work. It is quite a stylised piece and it\u2019s credit to the cast and the filmmakers that the characters engage us to the extent that they do.  One of the techniques used is that of the narrative \u2013 passages of prose from the short story is read by a narrator, giving us an insight into the character of giving dialogue to what is happening.  \u201cDelia lay awake that night, finally in the deep recesses of her memory\u2026\u201d goes the narration, when flashbacks dip in and out of the past to tell us Delia\u2019s story.  This first story is the least successful of the three and never really satisfies, even though Kyra Sedgwick\u2019s performance is heartbreaking.  I really enjoyed the second story in which Parker Posey\u2019s Greta is absolutely intriguing. Married for four years, Greta is a book editor, \u2018great at trimming fat\u2019.  We learn of her fidelity problem through flashbacks and her urge to get physical with her famous author client.  But her compulsion to get rid of redundant paragraphs goes one step further.  I was sorry to farewell Greta, but then we meet Paula who is a bit of a mystery girl. Her past unravels and her future becomes certain when she befriends a young boy hitchhiker with whom she connects.  Fairuza Balk\u2019s Paula is complex, frightened and confused.  The hitchhiker is the catalyst that allows her to work herself out. Each story runs for less than 30 minutes, but in that time, we learn plenty about the women, often freeze frames and jump cuts in time.  While it doesn\u2019t break new ground, Personal Velocity does offer great insight into the lives of these three women in crisis, and takes us to the brink of the crossroad.\u000a\u000aReview by Andrew L.

V \u201cStar Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\u201d was poorly received by critics when it debuted, so does it fare any better with its new up-conversion? Not really. The sci-fi adventure contains so many mistakes in casting, characters and direction, it\u2019s still terribly difficult to like. The story is basically sound. But, writer-director George Lucas should have delegated the screenplay and piloting to someone more experienced and savvy. So many mistakes along the way. Since this is only a summary, and not an essay or formal review, let me short-list the major disappointments:\u000a1. Dumbing it down for small children. That includes the disaster they call Jar Jar Binks. But, also the flawed performance of Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker. 2. Actors being allowed to perform badly: Natalie Portman, Keira Knightley, Samuel L. Jackson and Lloyd all needed help from a good director. They didn\u2019t get it. 3. The writing. Dull, stilted and childish. On the positive side:\u000a1. Good performances from Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Ray Park. 2. Darth Maul was truly something to get excited about. He was a product of technology and competent acting skills. 3. The fight scenes were well-executed and absorbing. 4. Tech credits are just what you would expect from George Lucas. So, how was the 3D? No better than any other film up-converted to the format. Your eyes strain to spot any differences from the original film. But, after a while you just sit back and watch it like any other film.\u000a

V\u000aIt must have been an unrivalled experience. Sitting in a darkened theatre, watching the text fade into the depths of deep space as John Williams\u2019 marching-beat fanfare filled the room. It must have been exhilarating to take in the wonderful music and majestic visuals with the senses unsullied by the overexposure soon to come, or by foreknowledge of the sterile storyline. \u000a\u000aI do regret having missed that moment. I\u2019m not quite sure what was preoccupying my prepubescent mind in 1977, but for some reason a viewing of George Lucas\u2019 great advance in sci-fi cinema was not among the entertainments I bugged the oldies for that year. So I came to Star Wars in piecemeal fashion; and having missed out on the instantaneous impression of that opening sequence, I\u2019ve long been underwhelmed by the whole extravaganza. The music is miraculous of course, but in my mind it\u2019s always had an existence of its own, isolated in some corner of the cosmos from the sci-fi circus that spawned it. Notwithstanding the first few minutes, Star Wars has always struck me as a tenth rate reworking of Kurosawa; the poetry of his medieval milieu having been siphoned off, and the residue flung into the extremities of time and space. \u000a\u000aIf it weren\u2019t for the music, I\u2019d just as soon it had disappeared down a black hole. Even Sir Alec Guinness expressed regret in latter years, as he pondered how much damage the cult of the special-effects blockbuster had rendered to the art of filmmaking. Still, his bank manager was no doubt chuffed by his turns as Obi-Wan; and as for the fans, Attack Of The Clones doesn\u2019t seem to carry the same implication of irony that it does for me. \u000a\u000aNot that the music is becoming repetitive. It\u2019s hard to tire of that classic theme, and in any case it\u2019s only used for bookends here. In between, the bulk of the score is anything but incidental; Williams is in his most playful mood and as usual The Force is with him, AKA The London Symphony Orchestra. \u000a\u000aThe performers might be British, but this is the quintessential Hollywood sound. At least in its contemporary form, of which Williams is perhaps the premier pioneer. His trademark action cues are here, swelling with strings, brass and percussion; and periodically augmented by shrilly trilling piccolos or a surprise from left galaxy \u2013 electric guitar! The dynamics leap between extremities, and Williams\u2019 fantastical woodwinds do their usual service at the gentle end. Pretty and magical as starlight. The entire soundtrack sways to the flow of dramatic tension, and it\u2019s almost enough to have a Star Wars cynic thinking there might be something interesting going on in the plot. There is also a stronger romantic element than ever before, with a bittersweet love theme acting as the score\u2019s principal motif. \u000a\u000aNow that Sir Alec has made his final exit, I feel a little lonely in my Star Wars apathy. So I owe a deep debt of gratitude to John Williams. At least there\u2019s one element of the saga I can always count on cherishing along with the rest of mankind.\u000a\u000aPublished June 6, 2002\u000a\u000a\u000a

VFrom A Fistful of Dollars to The Magnificent Seven and the recent 47 Ronin (of which we shall speak no more), the West has been remaking samurai movies since Akira Kurasawa was a lad. But did you ever hear of a Hollywood western getting samurised? You have now.\u000aRelocating the plot of Clint Eastwood's Best Picture® to the wilds of northern Japan, writer-director Sang-il Lee casts Ken Watanabe in the Clint role as Jubei "The Killer" Kamata, a legendary samurai warrior forced into hiding after fighting for a defeated shogun.\u000aTen years later, he is a widowed father of two, living in poverty on the harsh outland of Hokkaido. But thanks to his dead wife, at least he is now a man of peace...  until his old mate Kingo (Akira Emoto) shows up with news that there's a juicy reward on the heads of two miscreants who have sliced up a young prostitute.\u000aReluctantly digging up his sword (and giving any watching child welfare officers serious cause for concern), Jubei sets out to right the wrong and earn a few much-needed bob in the process.\u000aAlong the way, Jubei and Kingo are joined by an aspiring bounty hunter bearing the look and swagger of a ronin Russell Brand.\u000aBut the upstart's bravado quickly fades when they run into ruthless sheriff Oishi (Koichi Sato of Sukiyaki Western Django) who won't tolerate violence in his town - unless he's the one committing it.\u000aHaving dealt with one bounty hunter (and shanghaied his biographer), Oishi is keen to make a name for himself. But Jubei is driven by more than greed.\u000aWhat that might be, however, is never made particularly clear.\u000aThe original's themes of honour, justice and redemption are duly addressed. Director Lee even throws in parallels to the white man's treatment of Native Americans with a nod to the persecution of the Ainu aborigines by thuggish government militia.\u000aBut he does it without real conviction. And the motivations of his characters - most crucially, Jubei - remain ambiguous at best.\u000aAs a result, the film's primary impact is visual. Lee certainly has an eye for a landscape; preferably when it's covered in snow or lashed with rain. Languid to the point of ponderous, Jubei's journey never passes up a chance to take in the air.\u000aHis interior shots are expertly composed too. Indeed, it's at close quarters that the film gets its anti-violence message across most effectively.\u000aKilling is presented as an ugly, ignoble and ultimately unthrilling business. There's no shortage of bloodshed, but rare is the film that uses bullets and flashing blades to provoke sadness rather than excitement.\u000aRarer still is the one that has no heroes. So for a remake, Unforgiven is pretty unique... if you ignore the poster. That's a straightforward steal

V\u000aOf all silent movies, this is probably the best-known to contemporary viewers; the archetypal city of the future dreamt up by Fritz Lang and his collaborators in the 1920s now seems deeply familiar and oddly timeless, with its art deco skyscrapers linked by superhighways snaking through the air, while faceless workers toil in the catacombs beneath.  Yet in the truncated, faded versions generally shown on TV, Metropolis is probably more respected than enjoyed; stripped of its visual grandeur, the parabolic narrative can seem turgid and simple-minded.

p624
sg4
VA beautifully crafted, emotional tour de force from Clint Eastwood, Million Dollar Baby is a gripping drama that effortlessly tugs at everything that is honest and true.  Packaged as a boxing film, this heart-felt exploration of relationships takes you where you never expect to go and allows you to contemplate and struggle with its characters throughout their journey.'Protect yourself at all times,' is Frankie's philosophy, while the sign on the wall of his gym warns 'Tough ain't enough'. And while boxing may convey images of toughness, Million Dollar Baby simply uses it to lead us to the other side of tough, where vulnerability shimmers like a lake at sunrise.  Frankie is disillusioned by the world.  He feels guilty that his old pal Scrap (Morgan Freeman) lost an eye in a fight years ago when he was acting as cut-man, and even going to church every day doesn't take him any closer to the redemption he is seeking in the relationship with his estranged daughter.  He barely even notices Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) when she comes into his gym and tells her straight away that he doesn't train girls.  But Maggie is pursuing her dream and boxing is the only thing that makes her feel good.  She is hungry to box and an ultra-fit Swank makes us believe her passion.But Million Dollar Baby is not a movie about boxing.  It is a story about the relationship between Frankie and Maggie, who unexpectedly become vital to each other.  Maggie becomes the daughter Frankie has lost, while Frankie becomes Maggie's father, confidant and friend.  Their relationship develops slowly, but Frankie is quick to notice her commitment, hard-word and dedication, all of which he admires.  It's as though he gets involved despite himself and after all the hard work of training, success in the ring is inevitable.With his minimalist expression, Eastwood has never been more vulnerable, while Swank brings all the gusto and passion to her enthusiastic bid to reach for her dream.  Freeman's Scrap, who narrates the story, is always at the sidelines, and his relationship with Frankie is as comfortable as an old pair of shoes.  There's a wonderful scene in which Frankie berates Scrap for wearing socks filled with holes; it is hard to believe how entertaining a scene can be that describes the difference between day socks and night socks that double for day socks, when they become too holey.There's a moment during the world championship match in Las Vegas, when the entire mood of the film changes.  And we are carried by the mood.  Like real life, the tempest of trauma whistles for our attention. Haunting, provocative and overwhelmingly moving, Million Dollar Baby is a magnificent work from a masterful filmmaker who keeps delivering hat trick after hat trick.Review by Andrew L. Urban

V Turner in Mike Leigh\u2019s \u201cMr. Turner.\u201d\u000aI\u2019m certainly not an expert on 19th century British painters, but I can imagine that \u201cMr. Turner\u201d is made with such care that it could be a wonderful introduction to art students studying the life of Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775-1851). Director Mike Leigh and actor Timothy Spall have painted their own masterpiece. Turner\u2019s genius was established early in his career, and Leigh chose to focus on the latter half of the artist\u2019s life when he became even better known and more eccentric. Turner\u2019s devotion to his ailing father is clear in the film. As were the relationships with women that kept him unmarried, by choice, his entire life. Leigh\u2019s screenplay also captures Turner\u2019s artistic independence, both his stubbornness and epic vision. Great accolades can be heaped on Spall\u2019s interpretation of Turner. Did the artist grunt, groan and speak in spurts? I don\u2019t know and don\u2019t care. Spall dives deep and fascinates with his performance. It took me several minutes to adjust to his dialect, but I eventually heard every word spoken by this worthy actor. Most of the ensemble cast checks out as well. Dorothy Atkinson generates sympathy as Hannah Danby, Turner\u2019s devoted housekeeper. Marion Bailey does an admirable job as Sophia Booth, Turner\u2019s landlady and eventual lover. She made Turner\u2019s seaside home a peaceful, desirable retreat. Paul Jesson excelled as Turner\u2019s father. He and Spall played well off each other. The mutual love and devotion between these two characters was realized. The costumes, the sets, the cinematography transport you magnificently to Turner\u2019s era. I learned about art history and the human condition. I\u2019m inspired to know more about the artist and see his works in person, thanks to Mike Leigh, his cast and crew. Thank you.

V Now proclaimed as Britain\u2019s greatest artist, his talent is the soul of Mike Leigh\u2018s new film, Mr. Turner. Coming after his other historical dramas\u2014the effervescent Topsy-Turvy, about Gilbert and Sullivan, and the dreary, bleak Vera Drake, which focuses on an abortionist in the 1950s\u2014this is perhaps his most spare, yet illuminating film to date. He\u2019s certainly picked a perfect subject: Turner was a bona fide genius who never stopped experimenting or challenging convention, yet, as Leigh shows, his personal life was a mess, including unhappy illegitimate children and a rather odd housekeeper who provided à la carte services for her boss. Though Leigh\u2019s film follows a basic chronological approach, starting when the artist is at the height of his fame, it is arranged as a series of vignettes rather than a completely fleshed out, plot-driven movie. And for someone as complex as J.M.W. Turner, that is perhaps the best way to capture the dichotomy of the man. Coddled by his father, who runs his household, sells his paintings and even mixes the valuable pigments and colours used to create those spectacular works of art, Turner is a crude, driven man comfortable in his selfishness. His world revolves around his ability to translate three-dimensional vistas into two-dimensional paintings. He thinks nothing of dropping everything, and everyone, for a painting excursion. It\u2019s actor Timothy Spall who brings what could have been a two-dimensional caricature to life. Spall immersed himself in the Dickensian world of Victorian London, even spending two years learning to paint. His every twitch, lumpen step and grunt\u2014dialogue is at an absolute minimum\u2014conveys more than the wordiest of scripts. After winning at Cannes, Spall is all but guaranteed to get an Oscar nomination. Related reading: Brian D. Johnson\u2019s best films of 2014\u000aThe other force behind Mr. Turner who should earn an Oscar nod is Dick Pope, the movie\u2019s cinematographer, who turned film into a work that would rival any Turner painting. From the very first scene in the Dutch countryside, to the last of the dying artist, the lush visuals\u2014especially its raw landscapes and delicately gorgeous sunrises and sunsets\u2014celebrate the artist. Turner lived in a time of deprivation and enormous wealth, an era when constant work and graft was the only way the son of a barber could rise to be one of the art world\u2019s greats. Yet, for all his achievements and financial security, the unpolished, slovenly genius constantly chafed against convention. The scenes of Turner sizing up his competition, including John Constable, at the Royal Academy, are deliciously subversive. Ironically, as his works become less recognizable and more and more evocative\u2014Rain, Steam and Speed: The Great Western Railway breathes the disruptive fury and power of the new-fangled trains\u2014his personal life became more pedestrian, even happy. He settled down with a widow, Sophia Booth, who fussed over Turner with the same un-awed affection of his father. Even after his death, Turner was anything but normal: He gave most of his fortune away, and donated his collection of his own, best works to the nation. Even today, his namesakes\u2014the Turner Prize, for example\u2014conjures up images of innovation and experimentation. As the Guardian stated, \u201cIf the sun is God, as Turner is supposed to have said, this incandescent painter was the sun\u2019s high priest and art is indebted to him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a10 shares\u000a\u000a\u000a                Twitter            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Facebook            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Google+ Share            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                LinkedIn            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Reddit            \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                Email            \u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a                                googletag.pubads().definePassback('/1016727/MME_ROS_TextAd_Bottom',[660, 30]).display();\u000a                                \u000a\u000aBrowse filmJ.M.W.

VWatching Mike Leigh's Mr Turner is a little like being immersed in a beautiful painting. Exquisite to look at with wonderful cinematography and production design, this portrayal of British landscape painter, J.M.W. Turner is a showcase for veteran actor Timothy Spall, who embodies the complex man and the world in which he lives. Leigh's film is hardly a sympathetic view of Turner, who lacks social graces and skills and whose treatment of women has much to be desired. However, it effectively gives us a sense of the times and an insight into his passion for art and love affair with light. The opening sunrise shot with a windmill silhouetted in the background sets the scene beautifully. Two Dutch maids with white milking caps walk along the banks of the Dutch canal, while Mr Turner stands nearby with his sketchpad capturing the scene. This mesmerising imagery is typical of the two and a half hours that follow, allowing us to enter into Turner's world and see things through his eyes. Leigh canvasses two aspects of his life during its final 25 years - his art and his personal relationships. Both are fiery. Turner is portrayed as a terse man, ever scowling and never pandering to anyone. The scene at the Royal Academy when Turner places a dollop of red paint on his canvas much to the astonishment of the other artists - including his rival Constable - is one that is as fiery as any. I was interested in the scene in which he is offered a huge sum for the acquisition of all his works; his refusal is prompted by his stated wish to bequeath his work to the British nation so all his works can be displayed and viewed free of charge to the public.Exceedingly preoccupied is the description Turner offers his ex-mistress, who is introduced early in the piece, when she visits with his two illegitimate daughters. There are few courtesies offered. Nor are there niceties offered to the domestic with whom he shares rough sex against the bookcase. It is when Turner meets the twice-divorced Mrs Booth (Marion Bailey), the landlady of rooms with the finest views in Margate and where the sun makes its first appearance of the day that a relationship with some charm develops.  She is lost for words when he tells her

V \u000a\u000a\u000aWith acting that goes from passable to laughable, dialogue cheesier than feta fondue, and a story that\u2019s as silly as ever, this fifth Step Up isn\u2019t going to win over naysayers. To the plot\u2019s credit, it does twist the typical \u2018dance tournament\u2019 storyline slightly but it\u2019s not going to cause epiphanies, and neither will the tacky romance between Miami Heat\u2019s Sean and The Street\u2019s Andie. Ironically, the brief love plot between the Robot Guy and Robot Girl has more heart. However, as with martial arts films, dance flicks are ultimately valued for their choreography and complementary camera work. While Miami Heat went bonkers with its set pieces, it didn\u2019t present them as effectively as Step Up 3D. Thankfully, All In reverts back to the latter with its sparsely-edited, smoothly-shot sequences that clearly show the dancers at the top of their game (including Kiwi girl Parris Goebel). It\u2019s also some of the best live-action 3D you\u2019ll see in a cinema. The three acts each have their one big dance battle that continually ups the ante, from an awesomely implausible \u2018impromptu\u2019 showdown in a bar to a more traditional \u2013 but even more impressive \u2013 mid-movie dance battle set in a boxing ring. When the climax hits, All In lives up to its title, piling up characters from the Step Up universe for a mountainous finale. Step Up isn\u2019t high art, but it is the Fast & Furious of dance flicks, and All In makes breakdancing as entertaining to watch as any highway car chase.

Me,\u000a                    I see it as a scalpel-like allegory for religion - the Christian Church and in particular,\u000a                    a damnation of its benign nature as a control-freak. Take a look at The Truman Show\u2019s\u000a                    creator, Christof \u2013 his brown beret standing in for the gold halo of Christ, his\u000a                    credo of giving Truman the kind of kind world we \u2018should\u2019 be living in\u000a                    \u2026.And his sarcastic line, "Somebody help me, I\u2019m being spontaneous,"\u000a                    easily equates to the notion that God\u2019s gift of free will is supposed to set\u000a                    us free. I know it looks too obvious, but sometimes the obvious is obvious because\u000a                    it\u2019s obvious, if you see what I mean. Anyway, everything works, from the brilliant\u000a                    performances - Carrey is stunningly credible, pathos and irony, stubbornness and\u000a                    intelligence raging against the darkness of his horizons \u2013 to the brilliant\u000a                    production values. This is a brilliant, unique, unforgettable film."\u000aAndrew L. Urban\u000a"Trumania is here! One of the most eagerly awaited films this year, The Truman\u000a                    Show splendidly marries imagination with craft and flair, resulting in a wonderful\u000a                    adventure coloured by elements of psychology, manipulation, conscience, dependency and\u000a                    freedom. To begin with, the concept is innovative, imaginative and despicably delicious\u000a                    \u2013 and we the viewers, together with the entire cast (with the exception of Truman)\u000a                    are in on the gag! So there\u2019s a feeling of unity, linking the mental state of the\u000a                    cast on the big screen with that of the audience. And it draws you in. Truman is such a\u000a                    decent, likeable chap, and we are rooting for him immediately. Jim Carrey is magnetic in\u000a                    the role, combining his quirky, colourful and comedic persona with that of a confused,\u000a                    vulnerable and very human being. Carey IS Truman, and exercises tremendous restraint and\u000a                    control, stretching his character like pliable plasticine. Ed Harris brings great\u000a                    complexity to his Playing God role. He is the obsessed puppeteer, pulling every string,\u000a                    but retains an element of decency and conscience that has long been camouflaged. It\u2019s\u000a                    a sterling script that takes us beyond the looking glass into a world where life is\u000a                    orchestrated by the touch of a button. And Peter Weir knows the way. His direction\u000a                    captures every essence and element for which the film strives.

V The question, as answered in \u201cPrisoners,\u201d is pretty far. Hugh Jackman stars as Keller Dover, a man who never doubts the end justifies the means. When his six year old daughter is abducted along with another girl, he kidnaps a mentally challenged man whose van was seen in his neighborhood at the time of the abduction. Alex Jones (Paul Dano) clearly knows something, but is he really responsible for the crime? Keller takes Jones to an abandoned rental property and proceeds to torture him until he gets some answers. It\u2019s clear that Jones may not be able to give Keller what he needs to know, even if he so desired. Meantime, a police detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) is pouring his heart into the investigation with only limited success. The investigator and Dover battle over how involved Dover should be in the hunt for his missing daughter. \u201cPrisoners\u201d is a complex story well told. It\u2019s gritty, violent and even nauseating at times. It asks the tough questions and the answers don\u2019t necessarily add up to happily ever after. The torture scenes are difficult to watch. The performances are strong. And, the ending is as intense as it obscure. \u201cPrisoners\u201d was originally rated \u201cNC-17\u2033 by the MPAA. It was trimmed to an \u201cR\u201d rating, but let\u2019s say it\u2019s still a \u201chard\u201d \u201cR.\u201d  Plenty of seat squirming ahead. The Blu-ray combo pack contains a couple of featurettes, but not much else. I would have included the original cut of the film. Would have been interesting to compare the two. Bottom line:  Intense drama that wrestles with moral issues. Nicely written and acted. Genuine suspense.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aPrisoners is a pulpy crime thriller elevated to event film status by top-notch filmmakers. It outstays its welcome by a good half hour but still proves compelling, thanks in part to subject matter that practically demands emotional investment from an audience: children in peril. A lot of attention will go to Jackman\u2019s turn as a survivalist dad driven to extremes to find his abducted daughter, and to his credit he gives it his all. But it\u2019s Gyllenhaal\u2019s performance as Detective Loki that feels the most lived in (although he does overdo it with a certain nervous twitch), and it\u2019s with him that our sympathies ultimately lie. The central mystery that drives the movie ends up being a bit silly, stitched together from similar films that suggest every small American town houses at least one raving loony. A few of the more left-field plot turns remain puzzling once all has been revealed. But director Denis Villeneuve keeps the focus on the aftermath of the abductions, wallowing in the panic and grief and giving Jackman a chance to flex his acting muscles. With subject matter this dreary, Prisoners can be a bit of a slog at times. Villeneuve has a point to make about people being capable of terrible things when pushed to extremes, and he makes it very bluntly, only to drop this line of thought once it\u2019s time for the big finale. Prisoners can\u2019t seem to decide what sort of film it wants to be, and so it ends up slightly muddled, engrossing enough in the moment but frustratingly insubstantial on reflection.

The pair\u2019s rocky relationship feels light in comparison to the original\u2019s father-son conflict, but she\u2019s an extremely well-realised character nonetheless. A new threat comes in the form of Drago, a chest-thumping man mountain who looks to dominate everything by making a dragon army and shouting an awful lot. He\u2019s a fairly one-note villain \u2013 conquering his fears by being fearsome is all there is to him \u2013 but it\u2019s in service of teaching its young male audience an important lesson in masculinity: trust is more powerful than control.

VFollowing its inspirational introduction, the second chapter of the \u000adragon wranglers' handbook continues to pique the interest by putting \u000aits principles into splendidly illustrated practice.With the island of Berk now a model of Viking-dragon relations, young\u000a adventurer Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is keen to put grown-up \u000aresponsibilities on hold while he explores the world with his trusty \u000aserpent steed Toothless.But as the son of big chieftain Stoick (Gerard Butler), expectations weigh heavy on his shoulders - and his one remaining foot.His leadership skills are duly tested when a long-forgotten thorn in \u000aStoick's side - the vengeful dragon master Drago (Djimon Hounsou) - \u000areturns with a scorched-earth approach to world domination.Anxious to stop Drago from turning dragon against dragon (and human, obviously), Hiccup sets out to bargain for peace.Already a diplomatic nightmare, his mission is further complicated by\u000a a crew of dragon-trappers led by the boneheaded Eret (Harington) and \u000athe appearance of an ethereal dragon rider whose identity comes as a \u000ahuge surprise... to anyone who hasn't seen the trailer.This blast from the past takes place on what's essentially the island\u000a twin of Avatar's Pandora, where dragons roam free and the Cate \u000aBlanchett-voiced rider, Valka, slinks around like the last remaining \u000aNa'vi.For a hermit, Valka is a terrible show off. But then this is a world \u000aof curiosities, such as how Drago is able to control the minds of \u000adragons simply by bellowing loudly and making circles with a big stick, \u000aand why the younger generation of Berk all sound as though they were \u000araised on the opposite side of the Atlantic to their parents (alas, \u000aHiccup still hasn't outgrown his nasal Canadian drawl).However, as the inevitable confrontations come to pass, the movie \u000acouldn't make its big messages any clearer. The evils of tyranny and \u000aoppression are boldly addressed. Bolder still, not everyone gets to live\u000a happily ever after.But the seriousness never lasts long while ever Stoick's old mate \u000aGobber (Craig Ferguson) and Hiccup's fellow dragoneers are around \u000a(voiced as they are by the likes of Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig and \u000aChristopher Mintz-Plasse).One dramatic twist aside, the script tends to the derivative. A few \u000aof the action setpieces have a distinctly borrowed feel, beginning with a\u000a dragon race that looks like Quidditch with sheep before moving into \u000aAvatar territory and restaging key battles from the original Star Wars \u000atrilogy (baby dragons being the new Ewoks).What really impresses is how it all looks. The attention to detail is\u000a impeccable, from the showboating sweep of the aerial sequences to the \u000ainteractions and mannerisms of man, woman and beast.Textures and gestures are brilliantly rendered, the body language \u000asaying more about the characters and their relationships than any words,\u000a particularly between Hiccup and his leathery best friend - and his \u000afeisty girlfriend Astrid (America Ferrara).With 12 books in Cressida Cowell's best-selling series, there are \u000aplenty more exercises to come. The challenge is now to match the \u000astorytelling standards of the first with the animation of the second. \u000aPractice makes perfect

Based on Cressida Cowell's children's book, Dreamworks, the studio that warmed our hearts with Shrek, has created a tangible reality in which the mindset of its inhabitants who live in the "Meridien of Misery" is to slay the dragons at any cost. Killing dragons is everything, the teenage protagonist Hiccup (voice of Jay Baruchel) is told. But here's the rub. The skinny, scrawny son of the burly Chief (voice of Gerard Butler) isn't mad on the idea of violence, which is the conditioned mindset of all that live in the exotically fiery land of Berk. Make love, not war, is his mantra.The characters are a wonderful mix of 18th century caricatured Viking pirates with impressively thick beards, horned helmets, metal body protectors and broad Scottish accents with 21st century teens with American accents and plucky, adventurous dispositions willing to take risks. The film excels in the storytelling elements in which mood and character lure us into a dangerous, unpredictable world where dragons of all colours, shapes and sizes are believed to be the enemy. Kids are put through Dragon Training as a matter of course, to learn skills such as survival, attack and teamwork.It's droll and funny in a subtle, throw-away style as the story takes flight when Hiccup is pressured by his father to follow in his violent footsteps. With Hiccup, we learn that violence is not the only way and the way the unexpected relationship between Hiccup and the black, green-eyed dragon he names Toothless, is delightful. As Hiccup goes from heel to hero, our affection for the unlikely pair grows, as does our interest in his budding relationship with plucky tomboy Astrid (America Ferrera). The action hots up with spectacular fiery, flying dragon battle sequences, as well as a battle between father and son. The spectacle never comes at the cost of the emotional return and I admit to shedding a tear in the lead up to the climactic finish - all delivered in striking 3D. Just like the fire the dragons exhale, this film is hot.Review by Andrew L. Urban

Passion is the key to everything, as Ricardo Darín's retired Benjamín Esposito discovers, when he revisits a case that has haunted him for 25 years, which leads him into unexpected territory. Old wounds, old loves, mysteries of the heart and the fear of living a life of nothing all play a part in Juan José Campanella's beguiling adaptation of Eduardo Sacheri's novel whose intrigue accelerates into a full-blown tempest of fervour. If you need more temptation, just know that this is the film that won the Foreign Language Oscar in 2010.It is a complex film whose plot changes direction when you least expect it. Darin's Esposito is intent on looking back into the past as he begins to write a novel based on a violent case of rape and murder. But where to begin? Is it at a train station; is it the first day he meets Soledad Villamil's stunning judge Irene Menéndez Hastings; is it at the crime scene; or is it when eyes speak in a photograph? Like Esposito, we become fascinated by the woman at the centre of the violent crime. Get to know her better, her grieving husband Morales (Pablo Rago) says, as he shows Esposito photograph albums that offer an insight not only into her life but those around her.This is far from a traditional murder mystery.

VClever, cutting and irrepressible, The Simpsons Movie hits the big screen with all the humour and panache we have come to expect from the series. Playing on the notion that two minds are greater than one, eleven screenwriters have huddled together to come up with a concept that is large enough, topical enough and sustainable enough to have audiences dropping their donuts in delight. Environmental issues magnified to Simpsonesque proportions are the focus of the story and the result is quirky, witty and filled with hilarious throwaways. The integrity of the characters remains intact and those distinctive voices are a reassuring reminder of good times past and present. And of course at the heart of it all is the unshakeable bond of the world's most lovable and dysfunctional family.The first endearing thing about the movie is that it identifies the leap from tv series to movie and immediately includes us in the joke. Yes, here we are paying to see something that we could see free on television (we're all suckers!), and there is Bart busily writing 'I will not illegally download this movie' a hundred times on the school blackboard. Then we leap into the daily lives of the Simpsons. There's a funny sequence in which Bart goes skateboarding naked (to satisfy a dare from Homer), Lisa meets an Irish muso who shares her love of the environment, baby Maggie shows her smarts, Homer rescues and adopts a pig, and Marge hides their wedding video in her bee-hive of blue locks. Politics, religion and family relationships jostle jovially for screen time and President Schwarzenegger's philosophy of 'I lead, not read,' when presented with five options to determine the fate of environmentally compromised Springfield, results in its dome-isolation predicament.Highlights include a family exodus to Alaska for a fresh start, an Innuit throat singing epiphany and a romantic interlude between Homer and Marge, when the bluebirds of happiness and Bambi help set the mood. It's jam-packed with inventive ideas and wonderfully obtuse, madcap moments. Baby Maggie even utters her first word during the closing credits, which will no doubt have cash registers pinging furiously in anticipation. Catering for all ages, The Simpsons Movie happily bridges the generation gap, using hilarity to counter life's woes.Review by Andrew L. Urban

VThis superbly animated family comedy with a touch of coming of age is sweet and short, with a top cast voicing the surfing penguins. Yeah. Surfing penguins. They're really just like us humans, except they're penguins. All the human frailties are echoed in penguinland, and winning is the driving force - until maturity sets in. The film's message, that winning isn't the most important part of life but caring for others is, has a familiar Hollywood ring to it of course, but who can argue with it?The hero's journey is full of adventure and fun, as well as drama, but there's nothing in the film to scare its target market of pre-teens. The cute factor of penguins is easily harnessed with the exotic location of Pen Gu Island, where the surf's up, the sand's smooth and reality is far, far away.Central to the story is the fate of Z (voice of Jeff Bridges) who is a washed up champ, but a wise one. Shia LaBoeuf voices young Cody Maverick (the name taken from the Hollywood Guide to Naming Fictional Characters) with a terrific immediacy, and there are plenty of animation details to engage adults who get restless with the story. Best of all, surfers will be thrilled by the wonderful rendering of surf and sea, a genuine triumph. The film also gains from a more naturalistic approach to recording the voices; instead of one at a time, actors sharing a scene were recorded in the same booth, allowing for the sort of natural overlaps that occur in human conversations. It all adds up to a film you may not choose to see but if your nieces drag you along, you won't complain.\u000a\u000a\u000a

V \u000aA rich and fantastic world awaits us in this extraordinary film from Hayao Miyazaki (and a crew of thousands), through which our little heroine has to progress and learn responsibility amidst great dangers and fearsome spirits. She is wide eyed and terrified yet finds her inner strength when it\u2019s needed. Leaps of imagination provide thrills of surprise as we follow Chihiro on an adventure that is exotic, entertaining and exciting, even if you are grown up. Indeed, some of its best bits are best savoured by us oldies. Kids will be enchanted despite the two hour run-time; at my preview, there were several youngsters and they were spellbound. As was I. The voice cast create the characters with deeply satisfying results; Daveigh Chase captures the vulnerability and growing determination of Chihiro perfectly, and Suzanne Pleshette revels in the twin roles of Yubaba the bad witch and Zeniba the good witch. Her dialogue is perhaps the most sophisticated in the script. Susan Egan is great as Lin, the no-nonsense bathhouse girl who takes Chihiro under her wing. All the voices \u2013 including some for characters which are just sounds, like NoFace or the Stink Monster, are effective as triggers for our imaginations. (This is the English language version, but the Chauvel in Sydney and the Nova in Melbourne are showing the subtitled version.) The English version is superbly voiced, and offers an intriguing experience for anyone interested in the power of sound. Language carries with it enormous amounts of cultural baggage. The mood of a film is profoundly affected by the language, by the timbre of the voices (different for different languages) and by the cultural and historical backdrop of the language spoken. An American girl talking to her parents, for example, evokes a different cultural context to a Japanese girl saying similar things in Japanese. Yet Spirited Away overcomes this potential obstacle with a strong, well crafted script that balances mood and tone very successfully. (No doubt due to the fact that director Hayao Miyazaki worked with the Disney people on it.) There is humour and whimsy, all accessible without ever talking down to its audience. There are magic moments of animation wizardry and a sweeping orchestral score, as well as sparkling fun. \u000a\u000aReview by David Edwards

VA Susanne Bier film guarantees us a potent emotional journey, and this, Bier's first English language film, dissects hearts and searches for truths. Accept the good, we are told. But there is much more to accept than just the good. There is loss, jealousy, resentment and the compelling need to escape. The need to escape from fear, reality and the prison of our own making. With the effective use of tight close ups, we become captive to the emotional worlds of Bier's characters.As illuminating as fluorescent lighting, Benicio Del Toro's expressive face is used like a palette; his character Jerry becoming the catalyst for change. A study in complexity, Del Toro is fascinating to watch with his perceptive, sunken eyes, fidgety manner, furrowed brow and ever-questioning body language. It is a masterful performance, as he interacts with Halle Berry's initially resentful Audrey and the two children, who welcome him as a father-replacement. Six year old Micah Berry is as cute as a button playing Dory, the little boy scared to put his head underwater, while Alexis Llewellyn is excellent as Harper, the plaintive little girl who imagines she becomes a captive in a sad movie.While Jerry's journey is more dramatic, as he teeters on the tightrope of addiction to denial, Audrey's journey is more internal. Together they make a conflicted portrait of struggle to overcome pain. 'I hated you for so many years; but it now all seems so silly,' she tells him. David Duchovny's performance as Brian, who we meet in flashback, is key to the story's integrity. Also important to the evolvement of the characters are John Carroll Lynch's Howard, Brian's former running partner, and Alison Lohman's recovered addict Kelly, who understands the importance of taking things one day at a time.Things We Lost In The Fire is an emotionally rich film about the little things in life, which inevitably become big things. It's about the tangible and the intangible. Things that are said and those that are not. A film to savour.DVD special features include deleted scenes, trailer and a featurette about the making of the film.Review by Andrew L. Urban

Characters, on both sides of the good/bad divide, are developed enough to make them more than graphic elements to fill scenes, and low key romantic / domestic asides give the film more depth. \u000a\u000aThe multi-talented and popular Lau and Tony Leung (fondly remembered by anyone who saw In The Mood For Love) both deliver first class performances that go beyond the usual stereotypes of police dramas; they add vulnerability and internal tension to their characters.

V\u000aA massive chord from Don Giovanni \u2026. the demented shouts of a man in the snowy darkness. Two servants scurry urgently towards a locked door in a well-to-do 18th century home while stuffing whipped cream buns into their faces under the urgent strains of Mozart\u2019s Symphony No.25 in G Minor K183. From these first exquisite moments, we are enthralled by both the drama and the music in this exceptional movie, my top favourite bio-pic and one of my favourite films of all time. The natural marriage of the music with the story is so pleasing, so ordained even, that it doesn\u2019t matter whether you like classical music or not, whether you think Mozart is a confection or a composer. Milos Forman tells a wonderful story that\u2019s not only based on a real person of considerable interest, but he tells it with all the gusto of a filmmaker in full control of his craft and unafraid to show us historic figures in their undies, as it were. \u000a\u000aFrom Wolfie himself to Salieri and the Emperor Joseph II, we are treated to genuine characters, people filled with contradictions and self doubt, with jealousies and weaknesses. This film launched F. Murray Abraham\u2019s international career; Tom Hulce is so definitive as Wolfie he can never play another character convincingly; Jeffrey Jones IS Emperor Joseph II; Elizabeth Berridge is vulnerable and delightful and resilient as Constanze\u2026. The film is so good I even forgive the American accents of Hulce and Berridge\u2026.(In the commentary, Forman explains his approach to the spoken words, separating the nobility from the commoners, with the commoners speaking in a modern idiom, while the nobility spoke with a \u2018proper\u2019 English accent. The idea was to make the dialogue at once accessible as well as period-suggestive.)\u000a\u000aFilled with hundreds of magic moments and dozens of striking scenes, the energetic, vibrant and entertaining Amadeus stands up to repeated viewings over many years, with its outstanding production design and of course the sensational orchestrations performed by The Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner.\u000a\u000aMozart, whose music has been used in films as varied as My Left Foot and When Harry Met Sally, has never been better represented than here

V Action, romance, imagination and smart writing. At the center of it all is the onscreen chemistry between leads Andrew Garfield (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) and Emma Stone (Gwen Stacy. )  Without an adequate love story, an action film is only that, an action film. The story borrows from the first installment of Sam Raimi\u2019s trilogy. At least as it pertains to the offing of Parker\u2019s Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen). Besides that, the screenwriters, including Steve Kloves, keep it interesting and imaginative. Not everything is revealed at the end. But, the story is strong and holds your interest, unlike most films this time of year. Despite that death in the family, Garfield\u2019s Parker is more energetic, excited and tougher than his predecessor, Tobey Maguire. He is the spark that drives the action. He\u2019s fun to watch and he seems to be having fun. This Spidey is less reflective and more decisive than the version that ran before. Director Marc Webb shows Hollywood how its done. Make a film with excellent pacing and just enough romance to bring in a larger audience. This reboot is a major success and I hope the inevitable sequel will be just as good.

VWith a new, young, slightly cheaper cast and a director less inclined to do his own thing - previous Spidey director Sam Raimi's dismay at being forced to include Venom in Spidey 3 was indicative of the issues holding the franchise back - Sony are putting Spider-Man back into play for the long term.  \u000a\u000aBut where Raimi sought to create a faithful interpretation of how he saw the comic, the aptly named Marc Webb aims more for the Twilight audience, dressing Garfield's Peter Parker up as a hooded, introspective skater. A lost and troubled teenager desperate to know why his parents left him, before apparently dying in a plane crash. \u000a\u000aDrawn towards the mystery, Parker is led to his father's former lab partner, Dr Curt Connors (Ifans), a genetic scientist who sees cross-species DNA tinkering as the cure for most of life's ills. \u000a\u000aBut when Peter sneaks around Dr Connors' lab, he stumbles upon a complicated room full of spiders, and the rest, as you well know, is history. \u000a\u000aFor the first hour, Webb's Spider-Man is steady stuff. Although offering little improvement on the telling of the story, there's something neat about making the connection between Peter's missing parents, and his arachnoidal fate. \u000aThe fate of Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) is dealt with slightly differently, but to the same effect, as Parker dedicates his new-found skills to tracking down the tattooed villain who pulls the trigger on his kindly uncle. \u000aThe transformation sequences are amusing yet the pacing is a little muddled, with Peter going from suspicion of his new abiities to jumping off skyscrapers in one montage, and all but forgetting he's turning into a human spider as he woos high school chick Gwen (Emma Stone in the role of Parker's other love interest)... who just happens to be Dr Connors' lab assistant, and daughter of the chief of police George Stacey (Denis Leary), who's on the new vigilante's case.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the villainy comes in the form of a CGI lizard, for Dr Connors, intent on proving his research will work for the as-yet-unseen billionaire Norman Osborne, takes his medicine too early, and turns into a monster. \u000aOnce the first hour is up and the novelty factor of watching a teenager become a superhero wears off, Webb's Spider-Man loses steam and falls into a series of increasingly silly plotholes, not least in the denouement which, when looked at a little closer, doesn't make much sense at all. \u000a\u000aSure, this stuff can be overlooked - this is a movie about a boy who can climb walls after all - but when Spider-Man frequently takes off his mask, often to answer the mobile (Chris Nolan won't even let Christian Bale take his cowl off on set), it's difficult to be that forgiving. And then there's the crane scene; a sequence so illogical and poorly executed it'd struggle to make the cut of the TV cartoon. \u000a\u000aFortunately, the cast is peppered with talent, particularly with the exceedingly likeable Garfield adding depth to the fairly one-dimensional nerd, and Ifans offering a Doc Ock-level of shadiness to the non-CGI appearances of Dr Connors (if only his reptilian alter-ego was painted with as much detail). Indeed, Webb is clearly in his element when it comes to character development. \u000a\u000aJudged on its own merits, The Amazing Spider-Man is a decent comic booker, albeit based on a flawed, contrived, and somewhat cyclical script designed to set up a long-running series

VAbsolutely stock standard superhero stuff, The Amazing Spider-Man is, however, amazing on the level of its cinematic flourish. Spectacularly made, the film fuses the latest digital technology with some creative filmmaking - at least in the action department. This comic book character has had more screen reincarnations than I can recall, with each of the latest ones (2002, 2004, 2007 all with Tobey Maguire as the hero) working hard at making him a troubled young man on an earnest quest to balance his powers with his humanity. A need to be taken seriously.The moral of taking responsibility and the lessons of having to live with the consequences of our actions is the film's message board.Andrew Garfield is an excellent actor - as is Tobey Maguire - and he teases out everything that Mark Webb demands of his lead.

VAbsolutely stock standard superhero stuff, The Amazing Spider-Man is, however, amazing on the level of its cinematic flourish. Spectacularly made, the film fuses the latest digital technology with some creative filmmaking - at least in the action department. This comic book character has had more screen reincarnations than I can recall, with each of the latest ones (2002, 2004, 2007 all with Tobey Maguire as the hero) working hard at making him a troubled young man on an earnest quest to balance his powers with his humanity. A need to be taken seriously.The moral of taking responsibility and the lessons of having to live with the consequences of our actions is the film's message board.Andrew Garfield is an excellent actor - as is Tobey Maguire - and he teases out everything that Mark Webb demands of his lead.

V \u000aWords\u2014of the God-defying and the God-fearing\u2014enfold The Night of the Hunter. A Southern Gothic \u201950s classic, director Charles Laughton\u2019s only film (a flop on release) makes up, in atmospherics and its horribly righteous wrongdoer, for lapses into talkiness and staginess. A man talks aloud about where to hide stolen money as police sirens wail their approach; a girl, open-mouthed, points at the shadow of a man suddenly dwarfing her brother\u2019s little silhouette on their bedroom wall. That man, with his black Boss of the Plains hat and his knuckles tattooed with four-letter words\u2014his sinister hand bespeaking HATE, his right preaching LOVE\u2014is Reverend Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum). While in Moundsville Penitentiary for car theft, he hears that execution-bound cellmate Ben Harper hid his bank-robbery loot; he sets out to woo Harper\u2019s widow, Willa (Shelley Winters), and sniff out the cash. His talk\u2019s precursor to murderous action\u2014Powell\u2019s Biblical chastisements turn Willa into a woman bent on her past sins, even as he declares the Old Testament, that \u201cbook full of killin\u2019s,\u201d as justification for his future crimes. (In this grotesque take on Southern fundamentalism, it\u2019s the closest a film character\u2019s come to Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s killer The Misfit; its own influences are many\u2014in just the past decade, Undertow and Mud have floated in its wake.) Amid some stiltedness and overelaborated acting, Laughton lends some nice touches to critic James Agee\u2019s adaptation of Davis Grubbs\u2019 novel (based on lonely-hearts killer Harry Powers, hanged at Moundsville). There are God\u2019s-eye aerial views of small-town West Virginia during the Depression (when the country seemed, like the children here, orphaned and adrift); there are lullabies, songs and stories wrapping their sinuous sorrows around this story of seductions. (Powell sermonizes to self-convince, to sear his mark, and to sway others to his will; others\u2019 songs try to soothe.) There are the moody, often German Expressionist shots: a shadow-shrouded bedroom like a chapel of death; Willa\u2019s body in a car on the riverbed, her hair streaming in the current; switchblade-wielding Powell crashing through brush towards the children, trying to set off in a skiff downriver in the moonlight. And there\u2019s that twinkling gleam to the word-crafty, preaching predator\u2019s malice, which ensures this film glints and glitters on.

The magic ingredient of the drama is not George Bailey's kindness but the dark side of his character. He's shown to be angry and even violently frustrated at being stuck in a Nothingsville like Bedford Falls. It's what makes him human and makes us in believe in everything the film champions - the value of the individual and the strength of community ties. \u000a\u000aBailey's stand against Potter (Lionel Barrymore at his best), the miserly old capitalist slumlord who owns all of Bedford Falls except the part Bailey has helped build, strikes a powerful metaphorical chord today as one American corporate giant after another collapses in a corrupt heap. \u000a\u000aA film is only as old as it seems and It's A Wonderful Life transcends the times because it believes in all the good-hearted dreamers before and after George Bailey. The full-frame transfer on this no-frills disc is good with the exception of a few speckles during reel changes. It's a pity Australian DVD buyers aren't being offered the glorious remastered collector's edition released on Laser Disc and DVD overseas but for a budget purchase ($10-15 depending where you buy it) this local pressing represents decent value for your embattled Australian dollar.\u000a\u000aPublished August 1, 2002\u000a

V \u000aX-Men: Days of Future Past is less a continuation of Marvel\u2019s mutant series than a sequel to the early \u201960s-set X-Men: First Class, where distrust of homo sapiens superior nestled into American history, right at home among Cold War paranoia. Here, the main storyline in a time-travel tale sees Magneto\u2019s pro-war (against humans) stance and Professor Xavier\u2019s pro-peace position face off in the early \u201970s, just as the Vietnam War is about to end. The period details and zeitgeist echoes\u2014along with one bravura sequence\u2014make this another entertaining entry, though this rebooted, revised and repopulated franchise is starting to see diminishing returns. Stuffed with mutants, particularly in the framing storyline\u2014set in a near future time, all doomy and gloomy and pretty uninteresting, when adaptive robot Sentinels scour the globe, eradicating super-humans\u2014this blockbuster only really gets going when Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) travels back to Nixon\u2019s US to convince a young Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) to help him stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing the Sentinel-inventing Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage). The murder would ensure that his creations launch their mutant-genocide decades later. The break-out of Magneto is the movie\u2019s high-point, capped by a deliciously playful, slo-mo fast-guy sequence\u2014to the tune of Jim Croce\u2019s \u201972 ditty \u201cTime in a Bottle\u201d\u2014featuring Quicksilver (Evan Peters). There are other deft touches, too: a Beast-ly allusion, in Paris, to Victor Hugo\u2019s Hunchback of Notre-Dame; bystanders\u2019 Super 8 footage of mutant battles; mutants\u2019 ironic musings on time as \u201cimmutable\u201d or not\u2014if Wolverine must go back to convince Xavier to be the man he is already in Wolverine\u2019s future, is that an argument for cosmic fate or for supremely human free will? Of course, if all this seems rather silly and comic-book geeky, it is. But there\u2019s the paradox of our sci-fi-, fantasy- and superhero- dominated movie-present (and serious Brit-thespians Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, appearing in the doomy future part, blur these genres here, their roles little different from their turns as Captain Picard or Gandalf, respectively), which X-M: DFP freeze-frames perfectly. The more specific, humorous, and human the details, the faster time will pass in yet another story of a future human, non-human, or adamantium-clawed, self-healing, cigar-smoking X-Man.

The resulting work does a pretty nifty job of tidying up the series\u2019 convoluted and contradictory chronology, and features a couple of pretty cool set-pieces, but it\u2019s not the triumph it was surely designed to be. Despite the ambition of the time travel story, the narrative feels narrow. The epicness is stated rather that shown, and the world created consequently feels a bit small. The films\u2019 treatment of the Mystique character has always veered away from the source material, but it\u2019s hard to see her centrality here as anything more than a reflection of Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s rising star. Evan Peters makes am impression as Quicksilver, but he checks out of the movie early on, suggesting that he was perhaps a last-minute addition. The awe-inspiring set-piece focused on his super-speed abilities is the best thing in the movie, and nothing that happens afterwards lives up to it. X-Men: Days of Future Past veers between interesting and insipid for much of its running time. Singer\u2019s affection for the characters is clear, but the script is mostly sombre platitudes, and lacks the critical playfulness that Joss Whedon brought to The Avengers. Could\u2019ve been much worse though.

V It\u2019s a symphony of superbly coordinated action scenes that, as a whole, will appeal to the mainstream, not just the comic book crowd. How do I know? Well, I\u2019m not particularly into the X-Men mythology. I barely know the difference between Rogue and Shadowcat; Beast and Colossus. If I can make sense of Bryan Singer\u2019s new film, anyone can. So, why is this new X-Men film so good? Many reasons. Most of all, it\u2019s the writing and direction. A complicated time travel story with a huge cast, including then and now versions of our multitudinous heroes, is adeptly presented in glorious 3D. And, with a minimum of confusion. Like I said before: It\u2019s a symphony. \u201cX-Men: Days of Future Past\u201d borrows a bit from the \u201cStar Trek\u201d reboot. By involving time travel, some of the previous X-Men exploits are wiped clean and a younger generation of mutants are allowed to move the story forward in future sequels. The year is 2023 and most of the mutants have been wiped out by flying robots called Sentinels. These monstrosities absorb the individual superpowers of the mutants they encounter, thus fighting fire with fire. Whatever the mutants can do, the Sentinels can do better. And, they use their new skills to kill the mutants, one by one. Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), often enemies, unite in this dystopian future to send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to keep Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing the Sentinels inventor. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) was martyred by Mystique\u2019s bloodworks, prompting President Richard Nixon\u2019s approval of the Sentinels program. How do you stop Mystique? Magneto and Xavier decide to send Wolverine back to 1973, using the time travel powers of Shadowcat (Ellen Page). How do you tell such a complicated story stocked with so many characters without having the audience go crazy trying to keep up? Get the guy who\u2019s done it before many times, Bryan Singer. Not only is he a veteran of previous X-Men films, he knows how to handle complex plots (The Usual Suspects). Of course, a director is only good as his writer. And, Simon Kinberg gets huge kudos for making this breathtaking story jump from the page. Finally, the actors. Not only the truly talented thespians I mentioned previously. But, how about a tip of the hat to James McAvoy (young Professor X) and Michael Fassbender (young Magneto) and a breakthrough performance by Evan Peters as Quicksilver. Peters is bright, hip and oh so likable as the mutant with the ability to run at supersonic speeds. Oh, and a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d alert. Peter Dinklage is interesting to watch as the chief villain, Trask. But, this is the only role that could have been improved. It\u2019s a bit of a one-note character, and that\u2019s not the fault of the excellent actor who plays Lord Tyrion on the popular HBO series. \u201cX-Men: Days of Future Past\u201d is one of the best films I\u2019ve seen so far in 2014. It\u2019s more than just a super hero movie. It\u2019s a true champion of summer fun.

VHappy to report this is a satisfying full throttle spectacular that tinkers with minds as the past and present intersect and the future of the mutants and mankind hangs in the balance. With director Bryan Singer comfortably back in the saddle, there's a wondrous sense of scale about this ambitious Marvel adventure as the element of time travel to the 70's offers a springboard for unbridled creativity and imagination. The plot may occasionally defy logic, but logic can be overrated; the brilliance of ideas and their execution is more than enough to make this X-Men fantasy an outright winner.Beginning in a bleak future where the desolate, miserable world is without hope, the story's compass is put in train with the question 'Is the future set; or can we change it?' The fact that Hugh Jackman's Logan/Wolverine, with his ability to regenerate is the one able to survive the treacherous journey through time, ensures the appealing Jackman's presence front and centre. His mission is to change a key event in the past involving Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). The inclusion of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as younger versions of Patrick Stewart's Charles/Professor X and Ian McKellen's Erik/Magneto is inspired and both deliver magnificently. The scene when the older Charles confronts his younger self is eerily good and Fassbender as the metal-controlling mutant has carte blanche to display his considerable charisma.The time travel adventure begins when Logan wakes up in a water bed beside a lava lamp and a pretty girl, a Roberta Flack hit playing on the radio. The fact that he looks the same despite the 50 year leap into the past is well handled, and the challenges he faces with the young Charles (who has not acquired the wisdom of his later years) are often amusing. We are in on the joke and this is part of the film's charms and why it has so much appeal.Evan Peters is a real scene stealer as the silver-haired Quicksilver, whose talents lie in his ability to move with incredible speed. The brilliant scene when Quicksilver's slo-mo perspective of life is played out while everyone else freezes is the film's highlight. He walks on walls and the miniscule is magnified as Jim Croce's Time in a Bottle plays its haunting melody. Ah, the 70s!Peter Dinklage is a welcome addition to the cast, as the 70s scientist whose Sentinel program designed to eliminate mutants relies on obtaining the DNA of the fabulously curvaceous Mystique. Lawrence is striking and decorative as she morphs from different personas to her shimmering blue shapely self, her body manipulated into formidable FX situations. I am still chuckling at the left of field idea that JFK was a mutant and Erik was responsible for the curved bullet that killed him. Watch out for Mark Camacho as Richard Nixon. It's a superb cameo.The locations jump from New York, Moscow, China, Vietnam, Paris and Washington, where the extended and spectacular climactic sequences in front of the White House are set. This is a great example of how great special effects are used in line with the narrative and not for effects' sake. All the X-Men characters pop up at some time or other but it's the Big Five of Jackman, Stewart, McAvoy, Fassbender and Lawrence who keep the film's heart pumping and elevate it to its max.\u000a\u000a\u000a

VMarvel have shown the way. It was simpler than a thousand studio moguls could have possibly imagined.\u000aBut now the path is lit, there's no going back. The effects may be complex, the intertwining plots may be extremely detailed, and the fan-boy baiting is crucial, but there's only one lesson that needed to be learnt; the future is made of pre-planned, long-term franchises. \u000aThe X-Men, however, are a trickier prospect than the Marvel stable or even Disney's Star Wars saga.\u000aDespite comprising a stable of characters perfectly suited to the Marvel Studios template (they are, after all, Marvel heroes hiding out in a 20th Century Fox world), a combination of mis-steps (Ratner's X3 and at least the first Wolverine movie, in particular) scuppered any plans to turn the X-movies into a Marvel-like phased approach. \u000aEnter Days Of Future Past. A chance to wipe the slate clean. Singer's taken the best elements of the previous movies (there are six in total if you include the Wolverines, which Singer clearly doesn't) and set up a largely new X-franchise. \u000aIt all starts in the future. The world is in pieces. Hunter-killer robots known as Sentinels have been wiping out the mutants and anyone who might go on to give birth to a mutant. Humans and mutants alike are dead. Corpses are piled high on the streets in a sequence of shots that echo the original movie's Holocaustic opening. \u000aWhat remains of civilisation is left to hide in the ruins and pray the Sentinels don't find them, knowing full well, they will. A group of surviving mutants battle a trio of sentinels to the death, but the group has an ace up their sleeve - every time they are killed, Kitty (Ellen Page) sends Bishop (Omar Sy)'s consciousness back in time to warn the group of the next impending attack, so they can avoid it entirely. \u000aThe trick is the only effective measure against the Sentinels, who have adapted to nigh-on all the mutant powers, and one they repeat once the top dogs - Magneto, Xavier, Storm and Wolverine - arrive on the post-apocalyptic scene.\u000aUsing Kitty's mind-moving trick, the mutants send Wolverine's mind back to the early 70s, where he's to assemble the mutants and stop the slaughter from ever taking place. \u000aBut with the First Class now a disparate bunch of ex-class mates, either down on their luck (McAvoy's younger Xavier), incarcerated (Fassbender's Magneto, who may or may not be the gunman on the grassy knoll) or dead (Angel, Azezal and co.) Wolverine has some work to do if he's going to get the gang back together. \u000aJackman's Wolverine, so often the central character, once again does the heavy lifting, at least in terms of screen presence, and as much as this is an ensemble piece, McAvoy carries the story's emotion, and there's a lot of it to go around. \u000aWith Captain America falling from heli-carriers while taking multiple bullets and still coming up roses, and Superman smashing up half a city with his face, this is the first superhero movie in some time to have an element so often forgotten; genuine peril. \u000aDuring the future sequences in particular, there's a sense that any character could get dropped at any time. And they often do. Even in the past there's a palpable sense of danger. Particularly as we learn the time travel rules; anything could change, and it will be set in stone once Wolverine returns from his Kitty-induced slumber. \u000aLargely derivative but without feeling lazy, this is an X-outing that takes the best elements of the previous films, particularly the plot of X2, and rehashes it all through a hue of darkness. \u000aThe cast do a sterling job of conveying the danger, with Fassbender's Magneto a particular highlight, full of simmering rage to offer a rare dark spot in the colourful 70s palette. But even he's upstaged by Evan Peters' all-too-brief appearance as the super-speedy Quicksilver. \u000aIt's not without its flaws, and one particular gripe is for post-viewing discussion rather than review column inches, suffice to say, Fox aren't as interested in selling copies of X2 as they setting up the next instalments. \u000aIndeed, The X-Men films have shown a scant regard to continuity in the past, but the future looks set to be part of a much bigger plan. Fortunately, it's a lot of fun finding out who lives and who dies before the future arrives

For while Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy make for an engaging mismatched pair to rival Riggs and Murtagh and Foley and Rosewood, they\u2019re saddled with a predictable drug cartel plot that seems to needlessly stretch the running time by an extra 20 minutes. The central relationship initially also seems depressingly similar to McCarthy\u2019s earlier 2013 effort Identity Thief.

Both also get plenty of opportunities to showcase their adeptness at physical and visual gags, while a black humour approach to the action will have many cinema-goers wincing while doubled over with laughter. The Heat might lack the sheer balls-to-the-wall, gag-a-minute quality of The Other Guys or even the wacky charm of last year\u2019s 21 Jump Street remake, but it\u2019s both a reminder of Bullock\u2019s comedic talents and one of the best female comedic pairings since Tina Fey met Amy Poehler.

What works is the pairing and McCarthy's free-wheeling brand of humour, complete with expletives and ball-busting action is a great contrast to Bullock's playing it straight. TV screenwriter Katie Dippold's screenplay is not original or clever enough, but ambles on a predictable route while Bridesmaids director Paul Feig does a fair job of keeping everything together, leaving the comic performances by its two talented stars to carry the film.In the opening sequence, we see first hand how Bullock's earnest, hoity-toity Ashburn gets her man - with zealous book-learned know-how and a prissy attitude. She can sniff out drug-dealers and their stash more successfully than sniffer dogs and makes sure everybody knows it. McCarthy's Mullins also is successful when it comes to cuffing the locals crims, but uses intimidation tactics and brute force. As to be expected, when Ashburn and Mullins are teamed together to uncover a drug ring, it starts badly. They take an instant dislike to each other; Ashburn's 'sugar not stick' philosophy is not compatible with that of the impulsive, physical Mullins, whose refrigerator is crammed full of weaponry.The nightclub scene in which Ashburn tries to inconspicuously bug a suspect's mobile phone is quite funny with Bullock's physical comedy at its best, legs and arms flying after her severe wardrobe having been dramatically snipped in the Ladies Room. McCarthy simply throws it all out there with no restraint - language, violence and a risky hit-and-miss approach that finds its mark much of the time. Mullins' dysfunctional family is a nice, wacky invention albeit not well enough developed and the impromptu tracheotomy in the diner is totally off the wall. Blood alert!With a sequel already on its way, the filmmakers clearly have a scent for its commercial success, although let's hope that next time around, the screenplay has a little more originality and cohesion. As a result, the contrast of the black zaniness in the context of this odd-couple buddy movie will have the potential for more bite - and heat.Review by Andrew L. Urban

V So, it\u2019s doubly disappointing that the producers went cheap and stupid on the script. Sandra Bullock plays her uptight FBI agent from \u201cMiss Congeniality\u201d and Melissa McCarthy is a slovenly Boston cop. Together, they look to take down a mysterious drug kingpin plaguing Bean town in \u201cThe Heat.\u201d\u000aIt\u2019s refreshing to give us something new like a big-screen version of \u201cCagney and Lacey.\u201d  But, when you bombard us with every cop-buddy cliché in the book, are we supposed to roll over and say it\u2019s pure genius? No, can\u2019t do it. Everything\u2019s predictable. Before they even meet each other, they fight over a parking spot in front of the police station. They fight over the clothes they wear on the job. They wind up bonding and bust the bad guys, complimenting each other by the end. Is it fun to see the morbidly obese McCarthy curse like a sailor nonstop for two hours? No. If writer Katie Dippold had been a bit more sparing, the verbal fireworks might have been more effective. Is it fun to see Bullock NOT be able to curse for nearly two hours? No. But, we know that by the end she\u2019ll be up to speed and that\u2019s supposed to be hilarious. No, \u201cThe Heat\u201d didn\u2019t miss a single cop-buddy cliché.

VA Fistful of Dollars may lack the mournful intensity and Shakespearian comedy of the later Leone classics, but as an action film it holds up brilliantly.
p782

V\u000aThis is, strictly speaking, neither the first Sergio Leone film nor the first spaghetti Western, but it would be nice to believe that a career, a genre, a whole era of modern cinema could begin like this, with the absolute relaxed confidence of Clint Eastwood in a dusty poncho riding into town on his mule and pausing for a second to look up at the sky. A Fistful of Dollars may lack the mournful intensity and Shakespearian comedy of the later Leone classics, but as an action film it holds up brilliantly \u2013 the early Bond films, made at the same time, look impossibly quaint by comparison. \u000a\u000aLeone\u2019s style was to become more brazenly artificial with each film he made, but here already the ritualised action sequences are studies in what the novelist and critic G. Cabrera Infante called \u201cthe frozen geometry of the movies\u201d. At dramatic high points he typically brings proceedings to a halt in order to visualise a situation from all possible angles, challenging the audience to guess at future developments. Meanwhile, Ennio Morricone\u2019s score swirls on the soundtrack like a preview of the carnage to come. Above all, this kind of intensity in filmmaking is a matter of rhythm; Leone\u2019s precise timing often forces us to pay special attention to the most understated sights and sounds, from a barely suppressed smirk to the click of a cocked pistol. \u000a\u000aThis stress on the immediate physical consequences of events, rather than their broader symbolic meanings, can be related to Leone\u2019s philosophical anarchism

VAs far as spectacle goes, this final chapter of the Harry Potter franchise has plenty of it with showy special effects and a rich and alluring density that once again overshadows the narrative. There's little time for those unfamiliar with the story to pick up the threads although it would be fair to say that the key audiences for this grand finale are the initiated aficionados who have been hanging onto every little detail of the intricate world of the boy wizard since the series began 10 years ago. I felt as though the filmmakers were so keen to dazzle one and all with effect after effect that the simple art of storytelling has suffered in the process. As a result, I found myself dipping in and out of J. K. Rowling's wondrous fantasy world as the story comes to its dramatic conclusion.The story begins with the continuation of the search for remaining Horcruxes by Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) in a bid to discover the riddle of the evil Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) immortality. The early sequence in which they venture on a precarious ride through a chasm into an underground vault where everything they touch multiplies is one of the film's strongest with its wonderful white fire-breathing dragon that provides the required escape route when things get hairy. Of the creatures, I also like the grotesque goblins and the slithering python that yearns for human flesh that might well slither into the dreams of many an impressionable youngster.Perhaps the film's greatest weakness is that there is little interaction between the key characters; the main game is reliant on the ever-nearing showdown between Voldemort and Harry. If the weight of the battle between good and evil relies on a strong villain, the film certainly has that in Fiennes as Voldemort, an eerily repulsive figure with a pale nose-less face and claw-like talons. Alan Rickman's unforgettable Professor Snape uses his screen-time well and among the cast of familiar faces, it's good to see Maggie Smith in good form. There's a hint of romance too, with an anti-climactic kiss between Ron and Hermione that is over almost before it begins.The myriad of ideas leap at us from all directions and are often jumbled in the frenetic plot as the dramatic arc forgets to deliver one whiz bang satisfying emotional outcome to everything that has gone before. The fans however, will no doubt be well satisfied as the Harry Potter saga ends with good triumphing over evil and J. K. Rowling runs to the bank.Review by Andrew L. Urban

VAs fight films go, Warrior is as gutsy as they get, with not just a big cash prize at stake but a whole family. The screenplay builds on themes of guilt, grief, pain and love to flesh out a story about two sons and a father whose relationship was poured down the sink thanks to the alcohol Paddy (Nick Nolte) consumed in large quantities for many years.The family had split in three, with Tommy (Tom Hardy) and his mum going their way, but Brendan (Joel Edgerton) was a teenager in love and stayed around - not too close to dad, though. Tommy resents them all, especially for being left to deal with his mother's illness and death.This emotional backdrop is established through confrontations between the characters as a prelude to the big fight story, but it is interspersed with short fights to demonstrate that both brothers have fight in their genes - thanks to Paddy, a crusted, forlorn figure whose guilt is palpable. Nolte is terrific in the role, a complex blend of dried up pride, self loathing and yearning for forgiveness.But Tommy is also self loathing, with a demon from the Iraq battlefield - which is hidden to all but himself by an act of bravery. This aspect of the story (with battlefield flashbacks) feels a little contrived and forced, but it doesn't detract from our engagement.For Brendan, the stakes are simpler, although he is also distanced from his father and brother, clearly damaged by his upbringing. Absent father syndrome is a popular theme in recent films, and it always triggers profound emotional drama.This is surely Edgerton's big break as an actor, working in highly respected company in a mainstream film that will spread his name around the world. He grabs the opportunity and delivers a succinct characterisation which evokes sympathy and understanding for both his financial and father/brother dilemmas.As we would expect, each stage of the film escalates the stakes, whether in the fighting ring surrounded by wire (not so much a fence as a safety barrier for the audience), or in the fighting spaces between father and sons. We feel their anger, guilt and sorrow all rolled into a ball of pain.Writer/director Gavin O'Connor brings out the issues about family ties and their broken legacy with dramatic power and delivers the final resolution with subtlety and sensitivity. All his team delivers first class work, from the images to the music and the design. Warrior is a punchy and engaging film that draws us into its world with a bear hug - but it only hurts in a good way.Published first in the Sun-Herald.Review by Louise Keller

V The Dark Knight Rises, which opens next week, is the most hotly anticipated movie of the summer. And yes, it lives up to the hype. But what\u2019s most astonishing is not Batman\u2019s new flying machine that zooms around skyscraper canyons, or a flirty Anne Hathaway poured into a skin-tight catsuit and stiletto boots, or a muzzled terrorist who looks like an S&M wrestler on steroids. No, the most breathtaking moment in the epic finale of the Batman trilogy is when Michael Caine weeps. Why? That would be a spoiler. Let\u2019s just say the domestic bickering between Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) and Alfred (Caine), his paternal butler, finally comes to an emotional head. \u201cSir Michael Caine is always going to surprise you,\u201d says writer-director Christopher Nolan, on the phone from Los Angeles. \u201cHaving worked with him on five movies, I knew he was going to bring something special to that scene. But when he performed it, it was absolutely gutting. We sat there in dailies and people were just sobbing.\u201d\u000aDon\u2019t be surprised to see Caine honoured at the Oscars, or to see The Dark Knight Rises vie for Best Picture. Some franchises simply peter out. Nolan\u2019s trilogy, like the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter sagas, has an engineered momentum that builds to a monumental climax. After Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008), \u201cthis is not another episode in a series for us,\u201d says Nolan. \u201cIt\u2019s the third act in one large story.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt also lands as the third act of a superhero summer, the last of three blockbusters after Marvel\u2019s The Avengers and The Amazing Spider-Man. As an action movie with physical and emotional heft, The Dark Knight Rises would appear to be the heavyweight contender. But The Avengers vaulted past the Potter, Pirates and Transformers franchises to become the third-highest-grossing movie in history after Avatar and Titanic, reaping a worldwide box office of $1.4 billion. Tough act to follow\u2014even though The Dark Knight earned over $1 billion. Twenty years ago, who could have predicted that Hollywood would be a comic-book kingdom? Blame it on Tim Burton\u2019s Batman (1989), which spawned a breed of dark, operatic spectacles for grown-up fanboys. Now every self-respecting star needs a franchise and a mask, while comic-book culture ravages the ecology of the multiplex like an invasive species. But Nolan doesn\u2019t see his work as part of the trend. \u201cWe never saw our films as comic-book movies,\u201d he says. \u201cThe jumping-off point for Batman Begins was to make a movie, like any other adaptation.\u201d Yet he realizes that Rises\u2019 anchor spot in this superhero summer will affect its fate. \u201cHow it\u2019s going to do, I have no idea,\u201d says the 41-year-old British director. \u201cAll I can do is make the best film I can and hope people go along for the ride.\u201d\u000aThere is a lot riding on it. Everything about The Dark Knight Rises seems to be an escalation of scale. With an estimated budget of $250 million, it clocks in at a mighty two hours, 44 minutes. Half the movie was filmed in the giant IMAX format, while the rest was shot on 70-mm and 35-mm film. Stubbornly old-school, Nolan refused to use digital video or 3D. And he often chose bravura stunts over computer graphics\u2014from men dangling off a plane to 11,000 extras watching a football game as the field erupts with explosives. \u201cAudiences are ruthless in their demand for freshness and novelty,\u201d says Nolan. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to see the same thing again and again. They need to see it done in a different way and in a different place. It\u2019s a particular challenge with a sequel because you want familiar elements.\u201d\u000aAlong with Caine, they include Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman who return as Wayne\u2019s two other father figures, Commissioner Gordon and his CEO Lucius Fox, respectively. (\u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of fathers for an orphan,\u201d Nolan concedes.) But he has two new divas to play with: Hathaway\u2019s cat burglar Selina Kyle and philanthropist Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard). The Dark Knight Rises picks up the story eight years after The Dark Knight. Having taken the fall for the death of district attorney Harvey Dent, Batman has vanished. Bruce Wayne, the tycoon behind the cowl, is now a bearded recluse who walks with a cane, holed up in Wayne Manor like a Gotham Howard Hughes. When a ferocious new villain named Bane (Tom Hardy) lays siege to his financial empire, he hauls the batsuit out of storage. (It\u2019s surprising how little screen time it gets\u2014first we wait for Batman\u2019s return, and later, while Wayne is imprisoned in a pit, we wait for him to rise again.) Scarred by a horrific injury (what comic-book villain isn\u2019t? ), Bane is masked by a contraption that pumps him with painkillers\u2014though its main effect is to turn his accented voice into an unearthly growl while channelling shades of Hannibal Lecter and Blue Velvet\u2019s Dennis Hopper. Bane\u2019s dialogue could benefit from subtitles, especially since he has to explain so much of the plot. Batman\u2019s voice is distorted, too, so when they converse it\u2019s like listening to talking dogs. No matter: in the end, it all comes down to a fist fight. This time Batman is not just fighting crime, but saving his city from annihilation. Unlike Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker, who picked off victims one by one for sheer sport, Bane is a terrorist on a doomsday mission, armed with a nuclear device stolen from Wayne Industries. \u201cThat was an important part of giving this film the scale it needed,\u201d says Nolan. \u201cWhen you\u2019re just stuck in Gotham, there\u2019s a danger things start to feel a bit village-y.\u201d\u000aBetween the spectre of epic terrorism and the allure of lethal women, there\u2019s more of a James Bond feel to this Batman opus than the others. \u201cBut it\u2019s been there throughout,\u201d says Nolan. \u201cWe\u2019ve been shamelessly plundering the Bond movies that I loved growing up. It would be more obvious if it had an English character at the head. This is a very American story.\u201d Even if this Brit director has stocked it with Brit actors\u2014Bale, Caine, Oldman and Hardy. \u201cYou go for the right people for the job,\u201d he says, \u201cand they turn out to be English.\u201d\u000aThe pedigree of the cast imparts automatic gravitas. And unlike so many comic-book movies, from Iron Man to The Avengers, Nolan\u2019s work is not a maze of jokey, postmodern asides. These are action movies freighted with dramatic and intellectual ambition. Hathaway\u2019s Catwoman may come on like a Bond girl, an agent of comic and erotic relief, but she has a subversive agenda. \u201cThere\u2019s a storm coming,\u201d she tells Wayne. \u201cYou and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits, you\u2019re all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little to the rest of us.\u201d\u000aSound like Occupy Wall Street? Nolan did just that when he used 1,000 extras to film a pitched battle between cops and mercenaries in Manhattan. \u201cWhen we went to Wall Street to film, the Occupy movement had grown up around it and there were ridiculous reports we had chosen it for that reason. But it took a year of planning, and the scene had been written two years before that.\u201d While 9/11 casts a long shadow over Gotham\u2019s scenes of terrorist destruction, the Occupy echoes are prescient. Nolan \u201chad no way of knowing,\u201d says Bale. Filming just blocks from the protest, he recalls, \u201cI was looking at him\u2014how did you know?\u201d Gotham, explains Nolan, \u201cis a parallel world, and you wind up mirroring the concerns of the time.\u201d\u000aOne concern among those who care about cinema is that it\u2019s being overrun by comic-book franchises: the masked superhero has usurped the face of the movie star as Hollywood\u2019s most powerful icon. Which Nolan doesn\u2019t dispute. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely well into a phase where our actors are not willing to brand themselves as movie stars the way actors of the past did,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you look at a guy like Christian, whether he\u2019s wearing a mask or not, this is one of our great actors. But he wants to be different in every film. He doesn\u2019t want the audience to go to a Christian Bale movie; he wants them to come see the character he\u2019s playing. That\u2019s true of most leading men working today. That wasn\u2019t true 20 years ago.\u201d\u000aNolan and Bale say they are both done with Batman\u2014although The Dark Knight Rises ends on a note that will allow another filmmaker to pick up the franchise where they left off. But Nolan, still a force behind Hollywood\u2019s superhero hegemony, is producing next year\u2019s Superman reboot, Man of Steel. The key to comic-book material, he insists, is to treat it as \u201ca source for movies of different types, not a genre\u2014if the comic-book movie is a genre, like the western, the audience will want something different.\u201d\u000aAs for his own directing future, \u201cI have no idea where I\u2019m going next,\u201d says Nolan. Down the road, a Bond movie would not be out of the question. And he doesn\u2019t even rule out 3D, if it\u2019s appropriate. \u201cI\u2019m all about choice,\u201d he declares. \u201cI don\u2019t like being told the way I should make a film.\u201d For one of the few filmmakers who can stand up to the studios, that may be the ultimate Hollywood superpower\u2014the ability to say no.

V The answer continues to be \u201cno.\u201d\u000a\u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d is a magnificent way to close out an exciting trilogy. After eight years of self-imposed exile, the caped crusader (Christian Bale) deals with an urban terrorist called Bane (Tom Hardy. )  Batman\u2019s alter ego, Bruce Wayne, hides away in Wayne Manor, but no longer. He emerges as well, after catching a young woman rifling his safe. The Catwoman\u2019s (Anne Hathaway) strange agenda is somehow connected to an overall master plot to bring Gotham City to its knees. Bane seems to have everything working to his advantage, but it\u2019s a grand mystery what he\u2019s up to. There are quite a few new characters in \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises,\u201d and that\u2019s the way Nolan likes it. Nolan\u2019s films are intelligent, complex and scream for repeat viewings. Warner Brothers won\u2019t mind a bit. Just look how the director\u2019s earlier films have fared at the box office. I\u2019ve seen \u201cInception\u201d at least a dozen times and could watch it again tonight without thinking twice. Getting back to \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises,\u201d that\u2019s about as much description as you will find in my review. Getting into the story is half the fun and I don\u2019t want to rob you of that pleasure. It\u2019s a story that demands your full attention. Besides the stellar screenplay and amazing cast, you just have to MARVEL at how Nolan interweaves his characters. And, unlike the second film, I found the last 45 minutes of \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d to be the strongest act. The twists, the turns and the reveals are first-rate. Get out there, Batfans!

VThis is not the first time Batman has risen.  When Nolan originally took on the Dark Knight, the character was poisoned by the buffoonery of Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.  By playing it dead straight and deadly serious, the director oversaw a Lazarus-like rebirth.  \u000a\u000aBut, the man likes a challenge and with The Dark Knight he made The Greatest Comic Book Film Ever, redefining expectations of a superhero movie (to the tune of $1bn global box office).\u000a\u000aSo how does Christopher Nolan not only satisfyingly close his Bat-saga (succeeding where Spider-Man and X-Men are generally accepted to have failed), but also provide a worthy successor to that majestic second outing?\u000a\u000aHis answer is to Go Big.  HUGE. There are moments in The Dark Knight Rises that capture that same thrill audiences had when first seeing Metropolis, Star Wars and Blade Runner. The scale of Nolan's vision must be seen on the biggest screen possible for maximum impact.   \u000a\u000aYet, this scale isn't just visual (or aural), but emotional.  In place of The Dark Knight's fiendish plot and anarchic glee, The Dark Knight Rises goes to the heart of what trauma drives a quest for justice, revenge or terror and it's one of hell of a journey.  Those trailers with a shattered Bruce Wayne at super-villain Bane's mercy? Just the tip of the iceberg.\u000a\u000aEight years on since the events of The Dark Knight, the Batman is a phantom fugitive after taking the fall for Harvey Dent's death and Bruce Wayne a Howard Hughes-style gossiped about in hushed whispers.  \u000a\u000aAnd with Gotham virtually crime free, who needs a caped crusader? Bruce Wayne.  Empty now the Bat has flown, Wayne is a husk marking time, to the despair of faithful butler Alfred who yearns for the billionaire to move on.\u000a\u000aThings change when cat-burglar (though never named Catwoman) Selina Kyle arrives on the scene, filching a Wayne family heirloom and getting his attention.  \u000a\u000aBut, it's only when terrifying man-mountain super villain Bane arrives in Gotham, preaching liberation for the oppressed masses while spreading violence and murder (and surely the most snapped necks in a 12A movie) that the Dark Knight must rise once more.\u000a\u000aAllowing himself 164 minutes to tell this final chapter, Nolan again proves his talent for lean, economic storytelling at epic length.  \u000a\u000aHitting the ground running, The Dark Knight Rises races through incident and drama (including an early Selina Kyle double-cross shootout that practically guarantees the magnetic Hathaway a spin-off movie) and performs the difficult tightrope act of allowing each character room to breathe while knitting them into the epic multi-strand plot.  \u000a\u000aThis is a film where all of Gotham is taken hostage by Tom Hardy's Bane, a merciless revolutionary with a jihadist taste for public demonstrations of punishment ripped from the darker moments in the War on Terror. \u000a\u000aInevitably compared to Ledger's definitive Joker and suffering as a result, with Bane Nolan and co travel in the opposite direction; if the Joker was an unguided missile, Bane is a Tiger Tank lethally on target.  The Joker wanted chaos; Bane wants order, New World Order dressed in the sheep's clothing of the Occupy Movement\u000a\u000aAnd as portrayed by a pumped-up Hardy, he is terrifying: his mask a metallic baboon maw, his voice disconcertingly strangulated (and not difficult to understand, Nolan clearly having heeded online frets), his body a twisted mass of radicalised rage.  \u000a\u000aWhen Batman faces him midway through (so you get American Psycho vs. Bronson), it is a smackdown both exhilarating and nightmarish in visceral impact.  \u000a\u000aThank God then Christian Bale decided to return - no-one can do charm, innocence, rage and pain quite like him.  He gets plenty of opportunity to do all them, but particularly pain, with Bruce Wayne experiencing a literal Hell on Earth.\u000a\u000aFear not however, this Knight is not all doom and gloom.  Granted, audiences will be (willingly) put through the ringer, but these particular Batman films have consistently delivered spectacle once only possible on the printed page. \u000a\u000aBane's opening mid-air assault and Batman's return following an all-out assault on the  Stock Exchange and ensuing bike chase both drop jaws and send shivers down the spine, as does the sight of Batman and Kyle (okay, Catwoman), making short shrift of Bane's cohorts.  \u000a\u000aBut, it's in the final 45 minutes, when Commissioner Gordon (the ever excellent Oldman) and lawman John Blake (newcomer Gordon-Levitt, as good here as in Inception) attempt to break Bane's siege from within and all the main players come together for a showdown thrilling, shocking and full of surprises that it becomes clear Nolan is the blockbuster director every studio has on speed dial.  \u000a\u000aEnding a perfect hat trick of movies, all that remains to be said is, Chris, please don't foul it up with an Indiana Jones style fourth instalment

The uniqueness of the franchise with its anti-hero cop who always finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time has been hurled out of the window; director John Moore's film is action on steroids, accentuated by shaky camera work with an outrageous plot that is lost in translation in any event by undecipherable dialogue and weighty Russian accents. It's a pity it's not such a good day after all.In a prologue that plays like Russian mumbo jumbo, the plot line featuring an imprisoned nuclear scientist Komarov (Sebastian Koch) and bad-ass Defense Minister (Sergey Kokesnikov) is established. Then McClane's undercover CIA son Jack (Jai Courtney) gets involved and there is plenty of time for us to ogle at Courtney's impressive physique. With his intense presence, Courtney is the perfect action hero; in fact, Willis's larger-than-life status seems slightly diminished alongside the buff Courtney. While much of the accent focuses on the tense relationship between father and son with Jack repeating the catch phrase 'What are you doing here' and McClane complaining ad nauseum he is supposedly on vacation, the bonding inevitably comes into its own.Although hardly a family affair, McClane's daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who we met in 2007's Live Free or Die Hard, re-appears briefly. The scene in which she talks to her father on the phone draws laughs - he is navigating a high-speed stolen vehicle over freeways and other cars. Another phone laugh comes when he mutters something about his two year contract, when his iphone gets stomped on decisively.Shot in Moscow and Budapest, the action shifts to Chernobyl for the climactic big bang finish where McClane states his intention to kill all the scumbags. Unsurprisingly, he makes good on his words. The pity about the frenzied approach to the action scenes is that none of it is credible and instead of inciting tension, it's all pretty routine and there is little at stake.

V Of course, the box office for \u201cA Good Day to Die Hard\u201d may tell a different story. Suffice it to say that the fifth film in the series is the weakest of the bunch. John McClane (Bruce Willis) travels to Russia to help his estranged son find his way out of prison. When he arrives, it seems Jack (Jai Courtney) doesn\u2019t need any help. An explosion at a Moscow courthouse destroys the building, killing just about everyone except, of course, Jack and his fellow inmate, a Russian whistleblower and all around rich guy (Sebastian Koch). The two escape with Bruce Willis in tow. That\u2019s about as much of the plot that I reveal here. Wait a minute! That\u2019s almost the entire plot. The rest of the film is a series of chases and explosions. So many, in fact, it reminds me of a monster truck rally. People go to them, but I honestly wonder why sometimes. The special effects were impressive, but unless you have a good story to go with it, they mean nothing. The story is dumbed down to the point that you question whether the writers even know whether Chernobyl (site of that massive nuclear disaster) is in Ukraine. \u201cA Good Day to Die Hard\u201d has a heavily armed helicopter cruising over to Chernobyl without even being challenged by the Ukrainian military. Not likely, since the two countries don\u2019t actually get along. This is just a big, dumb action flick written by people who don\u2019t seem to know even the most basic information about the former Soviet Union.

Certainly not the kind of language expected to extract from Colin Firth's stammering future King of England during their treatment sessions. It may not be quite in the class of The Queen, but there's much to enjoy as we peek behind the scenes of the dysfunctional English Royal Family for a great yarn.The film begins in 1925, when we meet Firth's Duke of York Albert at his most insecure, stuttering his way through his first recorded speech broadcast. Prescribed smoking to relax the throat and a mouth full of marbles for enunciation do little to help, coupled with the inescapable pressures and expectations from within the family. There is Albert's ever-critical father King George V (Michael Gambon at his austere best) and taunting from brother Edward (Guy Pearce is excellent), who is at the whim of the indiscreet, twice divorced American divorcee Wallis Simpson (Eve Best, solid). It is Helena Bonham Carter's calm, down-to-earth wife, who provides Bertie, as he is known by those close to him, with unconditional support and who sheds her status like an unnecessary item of clothing to find Rush's Harley Street speech therapist Lionel Logue. Bonham Carter is superb, injecting great warmth and compassion into the character of the woman we would come to know as the Queen Mother.Class distinction teeters like a wobbly see-saw as Lionel tries to find a balance between making and overstepping his mark. There are clashes about everything - where the sessions take place, the subject matter they discuss and even what Lionel calls his royal patient. (Lionel gets his way on all counts.) That first encounter between Lionel and Bertie, when Bertie lays down his unconventional modus operandi and pushes his royal student beyond his comfort zone is a terrific scene as is the development of their relationship. It is this relationship that forms the heart of the film, describing their awkward, combative initial meetings to the all-important and lengthy war-time speech, when Lionel conducts Bertie, as a conductor would his orchestra. Speaking of which, the Mozart, Beethoven and Brahms source music is beautifully integrated into Alexandre Desplat's splendid score.There are many lovely scenes, like the one in which Bertie tells a bedtime story to his Princess daughters, the serious Elizabeth and fun-loving Margaret in the household that already shows its love for the royal corgi and is horse-mad. I also liked the scene when Lionel's wife (beautifully played by Jennifer Ehle) unexpectedly arrives home to find His and Her Majesty with her husband. Lionel has strictly honoured the code of patient confidentiality, even to his family. David Seidler's screenplay negotiates all the relationships and integrates them beautifully as the storyline reaches its ultimate climax. As Bertie, Firth gives a fine performance, albeit on occasions slightly mannered. Directed by Tom Hooper, this is a thoroughly enjoyable film, injected with humour and a fascinating insight into a little known aspect of history in which the King of England and a failed Australian actor form an unlikely bond.Review by Andrew L.

VOn an otherwise typical July 1938 night in Los Angeles, Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) staggers into his office after hours to dictate his confession for the insurance company's claims manager, Barton Keys (Edward G. Robinson). We know within minutes he murdered Dietrichson (Tom Powers) in collusion with Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). We even know the motive. Billy Wilder shows his remarkable filmmaking talents by nevertheless keeping us in suspense throughout the movie, often cited as the most impressive film noir ever made.It is such a dark script it took Wilde a while to find his cast; the characters are not very likeable and their moral compass has jammed at 'bad'. In 1944, these things mattered to actors; their image was at stake, in a West that took morality seriously. So it is ironic that he got two of the best actors around, at the height of their prowess. (The height lasted years for both, though ...)Ironically enough, it's cigar chomping Edward G. Robisnon, who always does grizzly baddies really well, who gets the part of the claims manager.Lovers of screen music will also revel in the score by the accomplished Miklós Rózsa, who can subtly accent an emotion as it comes out of a word of dialogue like none else. As for the cinematography, even on DVD (terrific transfer of remastered print) every scene is all soaked in atmos, thanks to the inspired lighting.The screenplay is a collaboration between Wilder and the master of hard boiled crime fiction, Raymond Chandler, and it shows. Some lines of dialogue are curvy and coloured but most cut the air like a knife cuts through soft butter. Stanwyck and MacMurray make the most of this material with performances that distil their characters into economical yet complete summaries. Small gestures, inflections and body language all accumulate to deliver a fascinating scenario that we can't help but watch as it winds relentlessly towards its majestically shadowy conclusion and terrific ending.Published

V\u000aBetter than most of today\u2019s big budget sci-fi/horror films, Alien became a classic the moment it was released. (My definition of a classic is one that you are happy to see many times over \u2013 it is of lasting value and interest.) The reasons are many, but primarily it\u2019s the screenplay and the direction. Performances are always important, but there are films with great performances that simply don\u2019t work.

VAfter risibly resisting the ravages of time in the likes of 88 Minutes and Righteous Kill, Al Pacino finally acts his age in a rewarding mash-up of Last of the Summer Wine and Goodfellas.\u000a\u000aHe plays Val, an LA gangster who's seen the best years of his life slip away while stoically serving a 28-year term for his partners in crime Doc (Walken) and Hirsch (Arkin).\u000a\u000aDoc is at the gates to greet the old jailbird - now resembling a cross between Richard Hammond and Ken Dodd - as he shuffles out of prison, gamely focussing on a night of sex, snorts and surf'n'turf.\u000a\u000aHowever, what he doesn't know is that Doc is under orders from bitter mafia boss Claphands (Margolis) to take him out because he believes Val was responsible for the death of his trigger-happy son, who died after getting caught in crossfire years before.\u000a\u000aLaunching into party time, Val finds himself swigging Doc's aftershave, robbing a pharmacy for Viagra and joining Hirsch - who has been sprung from a retirement home - for a carnal frenzy at a suburban knocking shop.\u000a\u000aIn a movie of many pleasures, it's the effortless acting from Walken (a paternal good guy with a talent for painting), Arkin (a dutiful widower with a sentimental streak as wide as a freeway) and Pacino (showing a neat gift for comic timing) that bowl this along at a tidy lick.\u000a\u000aWeighing in a lean 90 minutes, there's not an ounce of fat on a script that succeeds in being both poignant and poisonously funny, including a brothel madam (who insists she never takes money when faced with a menage a trios) being told by Val: "we won't pay you then'.\u000a\u000aAs the night wears on and Val's appointment with fate gets nearer, Stevens subtly ramps up the emotional dynamic with Doc connecting with his estranged family and the lads gearing up to confront their past once and for all.\u000a\u000aIt's old boys behaving badly...and they do it so well

V All three legends bring the spice to a sub-par story. But, the total is not enough to keep this flick from stinking. Pacino is the just-released-from-prison Val. The guy who would rather do 28 years of hard time than give up his confederates. Nevertheless, a crime boss wants him dead and he\u2019s put the squeeze on Doc (Walken) to do the deed. In fact, Doc has only a few hours to complete the task or he\u2019ll also be toast. Val and Doc have a couple of adventures including a randy introduction to an ED drug and some action at a local brothel. Oh, yes, we\u2019ve been here before. \u201cStand Up Guys\u201d has nothing original to offer. The pace does pick up a bit when the duo decides to become a trio by rescuing their former getaway driver (Arkin) from a local rest home. When all three actors are together, you can almost forgive the mediocre writing, because it then becomes about three fun actors playing onscreen versions of their past characters. We love Pacino, Walken and Arkin. And, that makes \u201cStand Up Guys\u201d even harder to take.

VTo know me is to fly with me, says George Clooney's Ryan Bingham, the corporate man with everything who learns that having no strings attached is not always a passport to contentment. Commitment, happiness and travel are the themes of Jason Reitman's bitingly good film which looks at the life of a high flyer for whom express lanes, corporate clubs and frequent flyer miles are the ultimate thrill. Clooney is perfectly cast as the charming, confident and cynical Ryan, whose backpack analogy describes how possessions and people weigh us down in the journey of life. It's funny, sardonic, insightful and ironic and Clooney casts his spell effortlessly.Clooney's Ryan is the man delighted to be travelling 322 days each year, because that means he only has to tolerate 43 days at home in his clinical Omaha apartment. Happiness means being up in the air, at arm's length from everyone. His job? 'To make limbo tolerable,' as he spins positives from negatives and cushions the blow for strangers he fires from different companies around the country. Vera Farmiga's Alex ('think of me as yourself with a vagina') is his perfect match; they both get turned on by elite status and compare their frequent flyer cards when they meet for the first time on a stop-over in Dallas. But there's turbulence in the cabin when Anna Kendrick's brilliant, young Natalie comes on the scene; her vision to save the company mega-bucks by cutting back on travel expenses and terminating staff by video link does not take reality into account. The fun begins when Ryan is forced to take Natalie on the road and life starts to ooze in different directions.Reitman is an astute writer and director and he judges this slick and layered adaptation of Walter Kirn's novel beautifully. There's humour, irony and poignancy in the side-plot involving Ryan's niece Julie (Melanie Lynskey) and her upcoming marriage to Jim (Danny McBride); when Ryan is asked to talk some sense into the groom with cold feet, he is definitely not the right man for the job. This is a charming film that touches on many truths. What more could we ask than to be in the company of the seductive Mr Clooney for this adventure that flies.Review by Andrew L. Urban

VAn inspiring story about the human spirit, United documents the sequence of events that led up to the devastating plane crash that killed eight of the team members of the legendary Manchester United football team known as Busby Babes. Although the subject matter may limit the appeal of the film to those who love football, the story is essentially a story about resilience and determination.Made as a TV movie and directed by James Strong, Chris Chibnall's screenplay tells the story through the eyes of 19 year old Bobby Charlton (Jack O'Connell), whose dreams have come true when he is selected to play in the team with his heroes. The tragic plane crash in a snow blizzard in Munich that killed eight of the team members is a turning point - not only for Bobby but for everyone who is touched by the disaster.In a striking opening sequence we see two men sitting in airplane seats. The unusual thing is that the two seats are adrift in the middle of a snow-covered tarmac. This is simply a taste of things to come, the story jumping in time to two years earlier when we get involved in the world of the Busby Babes. We meet the team on the field in practice and se Bobby's yearning to become part of the team. The team's coach Jimmy Murphy (David Tennant) instils a strong work ethic into Bobby and when the boss Matt Busby (Dougray Scott) gives him a chance, he is determined to make the most of it.We are there for the pep talks in the dressing room and the elation after a match but interestingly enough, no footage of matches is shown, apart from TV newsreel footage. Because we know what is about to happen, it is difficult for the filmmakers to develop the tension but we become involved in the camaraderie and get a sense of the mood on the plane before things go horribly wrong.The final reel deals with the aftermath - and how everyone concerned deals with the tragedy. While the people of Manchester show their support by sending letters, cards and money, it is the remaining members of the team who are left to decide what to do next. All the performances are convincing with special mention to Tennant and Scott as the Coach and Owner. There's no denying it's a powerful and moving story, although the film struggles to find its way.DATES AND VENUES

V\u000aIt's a privilege to write about One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, voted number 20 on the American Film Institute's list of its 100 Greatest Movies, and one of only three films to ever win all four major Oscars; Best Film, Best Director (Milos Foreman), Best Actor (Jack Nicholson) and Best Actress (Louise Fletcher). I have vivid memories of first reading the book in high school and the affect it had on me. The way it went into a secret world previously unknown to us and exposed the humanity and inhumanity within. The way the mental hospital represents a huge, well-oiled machine attended by nurse Ratched and driven by the crazed energy of R. P. McMurphy (note his initials RPM). \u000a\u000aOkay, so that's a bit academic, but who would argue that Cuckoo's Nest isn't one of the most profound and tragic movies ever made? Put it down to two things; Kesey's award winning story, and the then-risky casting of Jack Nicholson, who went truly crazy in The Shining but did his time in the Cuckoo's Nest. As revealed by producer Michael Douglas in the excellent 48 minute making-of documentary, Nicholson was considered only after the role was offered to Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando, who both passed. At one stage, director Milos Forman wanted Burt Reynolds, currently hot in Smokey and the Bandit! We learn that Kirk Douglas bought the rights to Kesey's book and turned it into a semi-successful play, and that it took another ten\u000ayears to turn into a film. The documentary also features interviews with Forman, Kesey, and with Nicholson, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Vincent Schiavelli, who get nauseous just recounting the sickening fishing boat excursion. Amusingly, Louise Fletcher admits that playing an ice-queen got to her, and with so many men having fun around her, she simply whipped off her top and showed them she was a real woman after all. \u000a\u000aThe DVD commentary by Forman, Douglas and Zaentz is one of the best I've heard yet, revealing plenty of funny stories on the kamikaze making of this masterpiece. Eight additional scenes, however, are interesting but not essential to the story. \u000a\u000aOne Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a must have special edition DVD. It's a vivid exploration of institutional life, an examination of male behaviour, an indictment of narrow thinking, and an unflinching tragedy. And it continues to disturb, amuse, and astound.\u000a\u000a\u000aPublished October 24, 2002

VHip hop fans, at least those who followed US East Coast rapper Biggie Small [aka Christopher Wallace] (Jamal Woolard) rejoice. Biggie gets the big star treatment in this biopic filled with fine actors - and two hours of hip hop. And it's not only the lyrics that are incomprehensible, but much of the dialogue, spoken in the heavily accented black American street language. We can however, make out lots of 'nigger', 'bitch', 'ya know what ahm talkin bout' and of course, 'f**k' and 'muthaf**ker'. Sometimes all these in a single line of dialogue. (Can't really call them sentences.) It wouldn't matter, though, if it communicated.The story is as garbled as the words, made even less clear by the hip hop style of filmmaking. Bling bling, dancing crowds and hip hopping artists (?) are featured - frantically, frequently, fervently.Biggie seems to have found maturity in his mid 20s, and there is little to recommend him as a role model - but this is a different world, and he was apparently influential. At least people listened to his songs (which is more than we can on this soundtrack). Jamal Woolard certainly fits the role for size and is credibly confused as a young man without a father as a male role model - the reason cited for his bad behaviour. Unfaithful, selfish, criminal and unskilled, he presents as a loser trying to prove his worth by succeeding in the world of rap.The film demonstrates how insular this world is, as the East and West coast artists and their fans engage in a deadly civil war - over the geographicality of rap, for pity's sake. The ritualistic behaviour, the jargon of the streets and the incessant posturing of the rapping community gets very tedious. There is little here to attract anyone but the core fan-base.\u000a\u000a\u000a

V Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck are\u000a just magic together in this delightful romantic comedy, which is\u000a perhaps one of the happiest and most enjoyable films ever made.\u000a The world fell in love with newcomer Hepburn, in this her first\u000a starring role as a modern princess, bored with her royal duties.\u000a We quickly see how tedious the beautiful Princess Ann, finds her\u000a role. She flips when given her next day\u2019s schedule; the\u000a injection given to her by the royal doctor is meant to calm her\u000a down and give her a good sleep. But when she looks out the window\u000a and sees normal people having fun, she decides to escape the\u000a confines of the embassy by climbing into a catering truck. The\u000a medication quickly takes effect, and she is reclining on the\u000a ledge of a fence ranting and raving when Joe Bradley (Peck), an\u000a American newspaper man heading home after a poker game - finds\u000a her. He thinks she has had too much to drink, but eventually\u000a takes her to his apartment where she spends the night on his\u000a couch. This being 1953 and he being Gregory Peck, he sleeps\u000a alone, but when she wakes up, she doesn\u2019t know that. (Well,\u000a she does know it\u2019s 1953\u2026) \u000a For security reasons, the officials keep Princess Ann\u2019s\u000a disappearance a secret, and issue a statement that she has taken\u000a ill. When Joe Bradley sees the Princess\u2019 photo in the paper,\u000a he realises who she is, and hopes to get an exclusive story.\u000a There is an absolutely delightful scene when Joe Bradley\u000a introduces the Princess to cameraman Irving, played to great\u000a effect by Eddie Albert. Irving is sure that he recognises the\u000a Princess, and Joe does everything he possibly can to make sure\u000a that Irving doesn\u2019t voice his suspicions. (This includes\u000a spilling his coffee, and kicking his chair over in a hilarious\u000a scene.) The two men give the Princess a tour of Rome she will\u000a never forget, with Irving taking photos with his tiny camera,\u000a disguised in his cigarette lighter. We watch the transformation\u000a as Princess Ann relaxes, has her hair cut, eats ice cream, gets\u000a flowers, takes a motor cycle ride and quickly learns the joys of\u000a freedom, while seeing the sights of Rome.\u000a Entirely filmed and recorded in Rome, William Wyler\u2019s\u000a direction makes good use of the sights. There are some memorable\u000a cameos such as the non-english speaking Italian taxi driver who\u000a wants Gregory Peck to take the sedated Audrey Hepburn from his\u000a taxi, so he can go home to his bambinos. And watch out for that\u000a lovely moment when Gregory Peck dares Audrey Hepburn to place her\u000a hand in the Mouth of Truth. Legend tells that whoever has told a\u000a lie will have his/her hand bitten off. Fabulous fun, easily\u000a stands up to be enjoyed over and over again.\u000a			                \u000a

In short, this is the latest young, fresh, hip British\u000a               blockbuster \u2013 but that Trainspotting/Reservoir Dogs formula is looking pretty tired\u000a               by now. As you'd expect, this New Lad romp is packed with designer violence, lovably\u000a               sadistic hoodlums and comic torture scenes; the Coen brothers' Miller's Crossing was\u000a               probably the main inspiration for the artfully grungy, sepia look, with pug-nosed\u000a               gangsters looming out of oil-painting shadows. Deprived of the 'regional' local colour\u000a               crucial to most recent British hits, the film scores some authenticity points with its\u000a               affection for Cockney rhyming slang and old-fashioned spiv types (miraculously fashionable\u000a               again). But the monotonously thuggish characters are really just cannon-fodder for a\u000a               series of rollicking shoot-em-up encounters that are supposed to be thrillingly 'amoral.'\u000a               In fact this jolly boys-own caper is about as edgy as a Famous Five adventure (the\u000a               presence of Dexter Fletcher, from the great kids' TV show Press Gang, makes the point).\u000a               The cynicism is real, though. This film is so empty it can't be intended as more than a\u000a               'calling card' \u2013 the director, Guy Ritchie, must be hoping he'll be asked to\u000a               Hollywood to make the next Batman sequel. Is Ritchie the UK's Next Big Thing? Well,\u000a               hopefully not."\u000aJake Wilson\u000a"At the risk of starting a very large fire, this film is all the things Pulp\u000a               Fiction could and should have been. The plot is very clever and has more twists than the\u000a               Great Ocean Road. It has a delirious pace (after a slow start) and threatens to draw you\u000a               from your seat at every turn as the fortunes of the protagonists change in flashes, from\u000a               sky-high to rock bottom. Thus begins a violent, dangerous and funny ride to the unexpected\u000a               conclusion of the film. There is little point trying to single out the most outstanding\u000a               person in this film, as it is such a clever ensemble of people with a brilliant clutch of\u000a               cameo appearances such as Danny John-Jules from Red Dwarf , who is sensational.

VPart of Bettie Page's appeal was the fact that she was wholesome. She had a wholesome look and a body that said otherwise. Her rise to notoriety was never by design, but by chance. She was an innocent, church-loving gal from Nashville, who agreed to pose for a few photographs. It took no time at all for her to discard 'the bits of material' that made up her bikini, and her association with Irving and Paula Klaw, who had a discerningly 'unusual' client list, led her to pose for the required S & M photographs and short films. Hers is a wonderful story, and Mary Harron's feature is both fascinating and surprising. With Gretchen Mol glowing in the title role, The Notorious Bettie Page opens the book on a woman who unknowingly became a sex icon, at a time when pop culture was in its first bloom.Although Bettie lost her innocence early in the piece, there was always something about her that remained naive. Her smile and demeanour - in this age of pointy bras, girdles and seamed stockings - were disarming and girlie. She quickly learned the art of 'clothes, pose and expression', but never hesitated when asked to lean over or lift her leg when wearing skimpy underwear, seemingly unaware of the effect her actions might bring. When naked, she was never burdened by self-consciousness, but exuded a joie de vivre that celebrated not only her physical attributes, but her innocence. What did she think of when asked to act out a fraught emotion? She thought of what Jesus might do to her for all her sins.Harron begins the story in a New York court room in 1955 during a senate investigation into pornography. It was in January of the same year that Bettie appeared in Hugh Heffner's new publication Playboy - wearing nothing but a Santa hat. At court, she cuts a lonely figure, sitting alone in the corridor dressed conservatively, waiting patiently to be called as a witness. Filmed in erotic black and white (with several colour sequences), the film encapsulates the complexity and paradoxical situation of the girl who found equal highs in religion and in her re-enacted, outlandish scenes dressed as a dominatrix. It is a wondrously entertaining biopic that gives a dazzling insight into a time when the world was ready to embrace the notion of a sex goddess, innocently.Review by Andrew L. Urban

VPainting its population of hookers, killers, desperados and degenerates in a beautifully stylised light, one-man studio Robert Rodriguez and comic creator Frank Miller turned 2005's Sin City into a cinematic landmark. Misanthropy never looked so cool.Visually at least, their somewhat belated sequel offers more of the same, with four more stories designed to delight the eye and darken the soul.The opener, "Just Another Saturday Night", reacquaints us with Mickey Rourke's punch-drunk brawler Marv as he tries to remember how he came to be standing next to a pile of wrecked cars and dying frat boys. As written and performed, there's never a dull moment with Marv.We also catch up with an old friend - albeit with a new face - in "A Dame To Kill For" as reckless private eye Dwight McCarthy makes his return in the form of Josh Brolin, having been played previously by Clive Owen.The change is explained during an episode that sees Dwight fall once again for the rarely concealed charms of his former squeeze, Ava Lord (Green).Needless to say, as the now-married schemer wraps every man she meets around her finger, Dwight is not the only person to have his face rearranged.Meanwhile, "The Long, Bad Night" follows the misfortunes of Gordon-Levitt's Johnny, a young card sharp who ill-advisedly crashes a poker game run by Sin City's worst loser, the untouchable Senator Roark (Boothe). As the only thread written directly for the screen, this one plays a mean first hand but ends in a disappointing bust.Finally, "Nancy's Last Dance" sees Jessica Alba's pole dancer plotting to avenge the death of Hartigan (Bruce Willis), the cop who sacrificed himself that she might live. It's not what Hartigan - or at least his ghost - wants, but when in Rome... Besides, the valiant Marv has always got her back.It doesn't take a degree in demographics to realise that most people only go to Sin City for three things: sex, power and revenge.In true noir tradition, it's a morality-free zone where most guys think from the groin and talk like Christian Bale's Batman with laryngitis. Another Sin City by-law dictates that the fewer the clothes, the deadlier the broad.Which undoubtedly makes Green's nakedly duplicitous Ava the most lethal dame in town. No mean feat, given the competition from dirty dancer Nancy, Old Town's pistol-packing mama Gail (Rosario Dawson) and her band of ninja call girls, and Juno Temple as Dwight's honey-trapping accomplice.As the latter's victim, Ray Liotta joins Christopher Lloyd, Jeremy Piven, Dennis Haysbert and Lady Gaga amongst numerous other major bit-parters queuing up to be shot - against the green screen - before Rodriguez creates digital havoc around them.Blades flash, heads roll, limbs fly, and breasts heave, all in glorious monochrome, with any slashes of colour generally the result of lip gloss or blood loss.Emotionally or physically, there's nastiness in every scene. Yet despite all the vendettas and manipulations ending with some kind of pay-off, there no sense of climax.With the element of originality gone, this trip to Sin City just ain't as gripping as the first.

V Of the weekend\u2019s four new releases reviewed here, only one qualifies as a horror movie\u2014Carrie. But there\u2019s more genuine horror in both 12 Years a Slave and A Touch of Sin than in Kimberly Pearce\u2019s post-feminist remake of Brian De Palma\u2019s classic. Steve\u2019s McQueen saga of 19-century bondage and Jia Zhangke\u2019s contemporary epic of vengeance in a corrupt China are  powerful pictures that confound us with jarring images of human brutality amid natural beauty. Both will likely find a place on my year-end top 10. As for The Fifth Estate, a thriller about unchained data, the horror is only of the psychological kind. But as played by Benedict Cumberbatch, protagonist Julian Assange could give Hannibal Lecter lessons in sangfroid. 12 Years A Slave\u000aOf the four films, 12 Years A Slave is by far the most harrowing, and momentous. There are still more films to come in 2013, but from where we stand now, it\u2019s shaping up to be the movie of the year. I haven\u2019t seen it since TIFF, but its images have not left me. Here\u2019s an expanded version of what I wrote about it at the time:\u000aEven though it\u2019s based on a true story that happened before the American Civil War, 12 Years A Slave waylays us with a sense of tremendous urgency. I say \u201cus,\u201d not just \u201cme,\u201d because I walked out of the theatre with that weight of collective sorrow you get from a good funeral. Leaving the cinema in a hushed congregation. Afraid to break the silence. Lost for words. Feeling that nothing I could say or write could begin to address the injustice, horror and degraded nobility that the movie so eloquently portrays. But I was left with contradictory responses. You wonder how a movie so hard to watch can be so ripe with beauty: the narrative is gilded with lush Southern landscapes that serve as a silent witness to the cruelty. You are amazed that the movie exists, such an opulent vision of atrocity, yet appalled that its story has taken so long to reach the screen. Not just this specific story, but the story of American slavery. Lurking in the background of so many Hollywood movies, it never been so fully represented until now. 12 Years A Slave is based on the memoir of Solomon Northup, a free black man in the North, and a skilled carpenter and fiddler, who was lured to Washington, D.C. by a pair of circus promoters in 1841, then kidnapped and sold into slavery in New Orleans. After the cartoonish pulp of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s exhilarating revenge fantasy, Django Unchained, Steve McQueen\u2019s epic is sobering, to say the least. Played with simmering yet titanic force by Chiwetel Ejiofor, Northup is no Django-like action hero. He is a literate, sophisticated man who struggles to defend his dignity as it is assaulted, diminished and ground into the dirt. McQueen has marshaled a strong cast. Benedict Cumberbatch has a smallish role as the plantation boss who first purchases him at auction. Although he has no compunction about separating a slave woman from her children, this patriarch\u2014who goes so far as to give Northup a violin\u2014is a relatively gentle man compared to his next owner, an alcoholic sadist named Epps (Michael Fassbender) who runs a cotton plantation. Yet Fassbender makes this monster utterly credible. As with Hunger and Shame,  McQueen doesn\u2019t pull any punches. There are scenes of unmitigated brutality, both a lynching and a flogging. Yet despite the extremity of the drama, McQueen has not crafted a black-and-white morality tale of good vs. evil. It\u2019s not relieved by the typical \u201ctriumph of the human spirit\u201d that passes for catharsis in Hollywood. It\u2019s too troubled and complex for that, as McQueen delves into the layers of compromise and guilt slaves endured in their struggle to survive. Northup isn\u2019t just a victim. He suffers the more nuanced indignity of collaboration, as he lives by his wits, using his education, while being careful not reveal too much of it. The heart of the narrative revolves around a young female slave named Patsey, the plantation\u2019s most productive cotton-picker, who becomes the target of Epps\u2019 sexual lust. Lupita Nyong\u2019o\u2014a Mexican-born, Kenyan-raised graduate of Yale\u2019s film school\u2014makes her screen acting debut in this role, and her performance is a revelation. The movie\u2019s most wrenching scene is one in which she is whipped for what feels like an eternity. McQueen shoots it in a single unbroken shot, not allowing the camera, or the audience, to look away. Producer Brad Pitt made the movie happen, and gave himself a modest role as the story\u2019s white knight, a Canadian carpenter who eventually comes to Northup\u2019s rescue. But freedom comes as more of a sad denouement than a salvation. The tragedy cannot be undone. This is not a Brad Pitt movie, a tale of a white guy saving a slave; he\u2019s just the story\u2019s concierge. The film belongs to Chiwetel and the remarkable ensemble that surrounds him. With McQueen, they\u2019ve created a landmark picture of devastating power. Carrie\u000aChloe Moretz in 'Carrie'\u000aWhy remake Carrie? Good question, given that the original movie was so potent, and that Sissy Spacek\u2019s iconic performance as Carrie was so definitive. The 1976 movie that Brian De Palma adapted from Stephen King\u2019s novel has become a landmark of sorts. It\u2019s the original Mean Girls, a cautionary tale about high-school bullying with catastrophic consequences, made decades before social-media shaming pushed the issue to the fore. But if you are going to update Carrie, Kimberly Peirce, who made the Oscar-winning Boys Don\u2019t Cry (1999), that seminal movie about persecuted sexuality, would seem an interesting choice of director. You would expect this feminist filmmaker to take a radically different approach from De Palma, who opened his movie with voyeur\u2019s paradise of frontal nudity in the girls\u2019 shower room. But Peirce\u2019s 2.0 upgrade is not as different as you\u2019d expect. It\u2019s a very literal remake of the De Palma movie with some revisionist touches. First the differences. For those who don\u2019t want to wait all the way to the end for a blast of horror, Pearce kicks things off with a grisly childbirth scene, in which Carrie\u2019s screaming mother gives birth to her alone, and is torn between embracing this spawn of Satan or killing her with a pair of scissors. Then fast-forward to high school, and things start took look more familiar\u2014though Peirce, predictably,  eliminates even a soupcon of nudity in the shower sequence. She goes through the motions of making a post-feminist, post-Internet Carrie, set in the Facebook world of contemporary youth. The director dutifully incorporates the issue of cyber-bulling\u2014in the shower scene, after Carrie reacts to her first period with bewildered screams, a cellphone camera captures her humiliation as the girl mob pelts as her with tampons. The video will go viral. Chloe Moretz, who cut her baby teeth as the action star of Kick-Ass, may seem an apt choice for the lead. Yet she faces an impossible task. No one could top Spacek\u2019s visceral yet ethereal performance, which still seems utterly real almost four decades later. (I re-screened De Palma\u2019s film again this week.) And the Moretz version of the character is cut from different cloth. Spacek was a fragile, damaged creature who could see her own weirdness in the mirror. She channelled her telekinetic power as a terrifying force beyond her control, even in the end. Moretz is self-possessed right from the start. She gets a kick out of her powers and works to master them, like a nascent comic-book superhero, doing levitation exercises on the furniture and orchestrating flying objects with her hands. In one of the key changes from the original script, she turns her powers on Mom before heading off to the prom and locks her in the closet. She doesn\u2019t just dodge Mom\u2019s mad Christian rants; she corrects her: \u201cI didn\u2019t sin. You sinned!\u201d And in the final act, this heroic, hyper-conscious Carrie takes her vengeance much further than in the original. It\u2019s more protracted and diabolical. Plus, she\u2019s armed with an arsenal of digital special effects\u2014 Kick-Ass Carrie has powers that film technology could not dream of in 1976. Cast as her mother, Julianne Moore takes an even more marked departure from her original character, who was over-played by Piper Laurie. Though she got an Oscar nomination for her over-acting, Laurie\u2019s performance doesn\u2019t hold up\u2014her unmitigated hysteria flies way over the top, as if she\u2019s failing an audition for a Tennessee Williams play. Moore seems to have over-compensated, keeping the character on a low, psychotic simmer. She\u2019s a repressed knot of self-hatred. She\u2019s also acquired a habit of abusing herself by cutting and scratching her skin\u2014some clinical mortification of the flesh. To that extent, she is less of a villain, more a victim of her own self-hatred in Peirce\u2019s feminist-lite paradigm. Incidentally, the filmmakers have also upped the ante of high-school sexuality, adding a dash of teenage sex (as normal dating activity) and a pregnancy. But aside from all those tweaks, the new Carrie has been very closely cloned from the old one. Entire scenes, shots and lines of dialogue are recycled from the original. And the structure remains completely intact. It\u2019s as if Peirce and her screenwriters (Lawrence D. Cohen and Roberto Aquirre-Sacasa) wanted to rehabilitate a classic and perform some cosmetic surgery, but were scared to mess with the bones of a story that worked so well in the first place. But by taking a safe, piecemeal approach\u2014and treating the original a sacred text rather than completely reinventing it\u2014the result at times seems weirdly anachronistic. Although fundamentalist Christianity is alive and well in America, it\u2019s much less likely these days that a schoolgirl of Carrie\u2019s age would be ignorant of menstruation. And although bullying is a serious problem in contemporary schools, it\u2019s also a hot-button issue. There\u2019s no apparent awareness of bullying among the characters, who seem stuck in a time warp. Which brings us back to the question, why remake the movie at all? There\u2019s a commercial rationale, of course. It\u2019s a property that can be re-packaged and resold for a young audience that hasn\u2019t seen the original. The problem is, Carrie has penetrated pop culture so deeply that even kids who haven\u2019t seen the 1976 movie are aware of it. How can can you shock people when it\u2019s impossible to spoil the ending: the blood-soaked girl in a prom dress is one of those images that\u2019s been permanently carved into the Halloween canon. Even Carrie\u2019s pig\u2019s-blood humiliation does not so tragic, because we are just waiting for her to unleash her superpowers. A Touch of Sin\u000aA Touch of Sin\u000aAgainst panoramic vistas, China\u2019s Jia Zhangke directs a suite of four stories splattered with vigilante gun violence, not all of it reprehensible. A kind of Chinese Pulp Fiction with a political pulse, it adds up to a powerful portrait of desperate individuals driven to extremes by official corruption and runaway commercial development. They range from a mine worker (Jiang Wu) who picks up a shotgun to get even with a super-rich boss, to a sauna attendant (Jia\u2019s wife and longtime leading lady Zhao Tao) who wreaks bloody vengeance against a sexual predator. As a contemporary revision of the W?xiá genre, these ultra-violent tales of explosive retribution are set against gorgeous landscapes in various far-flung corners of China. What\u2019s remarkable is that Jia partly based his stories on sensational real-life crimes that were well-known from the country\u2019s newspapers. They add up such a massive critique of China\u2019s new Cultural Revolution\u2014the decadence of unbridled state capitalism\u2014that it\u2019s surprising government censors have allowed the film to reach the screen. For my interview with the director, conducted during TIFF, go to: Jia Zhangke on violent redemption, censorship and Ai Wei Wei. The Fifth Estate\u000a(from left) Benedict Cumberbatch, Carice van Houten, Daniel Brühl, Moritz Bleibtreu in 'The Fifth Estate'\u000aThis breathless thriller that treats the speed of data as a matter of life and death. Directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Bill Condon (Kinsey, Dreamgirls), this propulsive drama does for Julian Assange what The Social Network did for Facebook mogul Mark Zuckerberg. It portrays him as a visionary who is pathologically insensitive, a genius with a cruel wit whose single-minded ambition leads him to betray his partners and his sources. But unlike Zuckerberg, who seems to have no higher goal in life that personal power, Assange comes across as a genuine revolutionary with a mission that unfolds like a sub-atomic particle accelerator. He\u2019s a cyber-hybrid of hero and villain. Like his long-suffering accomplice, Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Brühl), we can\u2019t help but get caught up in his vortex, especially when the actor is Benedict Cumberbatch, who so on fire these days you wonder if he\u2019s human. Like the character, the film\u2019s narrative arc of ambition and betrayal is a construct that may be too conveniently symmetrical. Critics intimate with WikiLeaks claim that it is grossly one-sided, as it\u2019s based on Domscheit-Berg\u2019s book. But the issues raised by the film are compelling\u2014especially in the frenzied WikiLeaks negotiations with the mainstream press, which is personified by a Guardian editor played by the always-sharp David Thewlis. (There is, of course, nothing new about creating suspense from the largely silent and uneventful business of delivering news to a deadline\u2014the newsroom has been as exciting as the O.K.

V \u000a\u000a\u000aDespite reports to the contrary, Steve McQueen\u2019s Oscar-bait drama is not the greatest film ever made. It may well be the greatest film ever made about slavery, but that says more about the movie world than the work itself. Playing real-life free man Solomon Northup, who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1840\u2032s Louisiana, Chiwetel Ejiofor gives a typically strong performance. As do his starry co-stars \u2013 producer/saviour Brad Pitt, slave trader Paul Giamatti, progressive plantation owner Benedict Cumberbatch, and Solomon\u2019s main tormentor, psychotic owner Michael Fassbender \u2013 who inhabit a picaresque purgatory of almost Dickensian grotesquery. Like Tarantino before him, McQueen pulls no punches in the depiction and infliction of violence. Quite the opposite. Solomon is beaten until the whip breaks, Eliza (Adepero Oduye) wails as her children sold off. Meanwhile, the scene where poor Patsey (the excellent Lupita Nyong\u2019o) is whipped almost to death by a drunk, ranting Fassbender is so horrifying it eclipses the other 130 minutes. It\u2019s an unflinching film, and extremely well made, but it\u2019s also a limited one: overlong, schematic, a touch distant. Sometimes it seems McQueen is only comfortable showing the nadir of human behaviour, something borne out in both Shame and Hunger. And no matter what Solomon endures, he\u2019s never more than a noble cypher, a figure lost in the landscape. The ultimate irony is that, even with an incredible true story, a once-in-a-lifetime cast and much technical expertise at his disposal, McQueen still can\u2019t manage to make Solomon a person. Surely we\u2019ve come further than that?

VHollywood has always been more than happy to take on the role of America's hand-wringing moral conscience, churning out movies that lift the lid on Uncle Sam's more unsavoury deeds both at home and abroad.\u000a\u000aDodgy goings-on in Iraq (Green Zone, Battle For Haditha), dirty tricks in Latin America (Salvador, Missing), the ignominious tragedy of Vietnam (Born on the Fourth of July, Casualties of War), institutionalised homophobia (Milk, Philadelphia), CIA duplicity (The Bourne saga, Clear and Present Danger)...\u000a\u000aThe list goes on and on...with one notable exception. Slavery. A subject so thorny Tinseltown has largely steered clear of despite it being one of the most indelible stains on the Stars'n'Stripes.\u000aAs Brit director Steve McQueen points out "Slavery lasted 400 years and there are less than 20 [films]. We have to redress that balance and look at that time in history."\u000a\u000aWith searing conviction he achieves this in a relentless, raw and visceral condemnation of a viciously racist regime that condemned its victims to a life of hard labour with random cruelties thrown in and justified by a skewed interpretation of the Old Testament.\u000a\u000aThe shocking system of serfdom is seen through the eyes of Solomon Northrup (Ejiofor), a comfortably-off violinist who lives a conventional 19th century life with his wife and children in the accepting town of Saratoga Springs in upstate New York.\u000a\u000aHowever, this all changes when he accepts an invitation from two white businessman to perform at a musical engagement in Washington DC. Plied with drink, he groggily wakes up to find himself literally in chains and en route to a life of servitude in Louisiana.\u000a\u000aBrusquely despatched to the plantation of Ford (Cumberbatch) by Paul Giamatti's venal slave trader (he thinks nothing of separating mothers from children to close a sale), Northup - now given the slave name of Pratt Hamilton - struggles to assert his identity and keep alive his hopes of freedom. "I don't want to survive. I want to live," he says.\u000a\u000aFord is a demanding yet insightful master, piously severe but not entirely unsympathetic, who is forced to let Solomon go following a brutal run-in with Paul Dano's sadistic overseer (the extended scene where Solomon, a noose tight around his neck and his feet barely brushing the ground while his fellow slaves are obliged to work round him, is one of the movie's most memorable).\u000a\u000aThings can't get worse...and then they do. Solomon is sold off to monstrous cotton plantation master Epps (Fassbender), a bible-spouting sadist torn between loathing and lust, the object of his warped affection being uber-productive slave girl Patsey (Nyong'o, superb), who also incurs the jealous wrath of the ice-hearted Mrs Epps (Sarah Paulson) who shows her displeasure by smashing the girl in the face with a crystal decanter.\u000a\u000aMcQueen's finest movie yet dispenses with the distracting trickiness that marred Hunger and Shame and goes for the throat in a gruelling, full-blooded indictment of this brutalising business, extracting from Ejiofor a steely performance of power and empathy in his portrayal of a man who heroically remains unbowed.\u000a\u000aHis fate plays out in the warped moral framework of the antebellum, where a couple of black unfortunates can be casually hanged by an amiable mob less than a mile from clapboard mansion where a befrocked black southern woman (Alfre Woodward) can sip tea on the veranda after winning the affection of her white master.\u000a\u000aMcQueen and cinematographer Sean Bobbit's composition is masterful, evoking a sun-dappled arcadia where profound evil pervades, occasionally stirring in the form of Epps to strip the flesh of a bewildered young girl with a bullwhip or to act pally while informing Solomon that's he's about to die.\u000a\u000aThis brave, unsentimental, honest movie achieves what Steven Spielberg did with Schindler's List and the Holocaust - it gives a mainstream cinema audience an insight into the unspeakable

VThere are a few amusing touches, but overall, Mortdecai sinks to the depths, its potential battered by an overdose of ham and a mannered performance by Johnny Depp that just doesn't fire. His Mortdecai caricature is an unhappy mix of Mike Myers as Austin Powers, Peter Sellers and Terry Thomas, complete with front-teeth gap, while the film's big joke is his twirled and upturned moustache. How many jokes can a wimpy moustache carry? The film reeks of self-importance instead of the light-hearted fun it might have been, never allowing the joys of the intended lunacy to soar. Based on the 1970s novel by Kyril Bonfiglioli, the plotline involving Depp's art-dealer conman, his brainy trophy wife Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow), his manservant Jock Strap (Paul Bettany), toffy Mi5 agent Martland (Ewan McGregor), plus an assortment of others is convoluted, as they search for a missing Goya painting. It's a caper that gets stuck in Depp's clunky characterization, which is as self-conscious as his Jack Sparrow (from Pirates of the Caribbean) is inspired. Some of the upstairs downstairs humour is quite droll as Mortdecai, Lord of a rather stately manor, does his best to avoid insolvency

Eastwood's holster is stacked with humour and pathos as the story canvasses relationships, multi-cultural gang warfare and Walt's treasured Gran Torino, which symbolises life itself.It's a far cry from the wandering gunfighter of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns of the 60s, Dirty Harry's modern day gunfighter of the 70s and 80s, or Unforgiven's retired gunslinger of the 90s. Walt is a disillusioned, anti-social, intolerant Agnostic who keeps to himself, talks to himself, spits, swears and keeps a gun close by. His only friend is his loyal Labrador Daisy and the highlight of his week is to drink beer on his porch and look at his prized car, parked in the driveway.

He shows no tolerance for his Asian neighbours (he even threatens them with a gun when they come on his patch of lawn), but a relationship begins - first with Ahney Her's happy-go-lucky Sue Lor, followed by one with Bee Vang's submissive Thao Vang Lor, who he aspires to 'man up a bit'. The humour that weaves in and out is the result of the straight-shooter Walt saying exactly what he thinks. He is a fish out of water in a rough and tumble neighbourhood where bullying and violence form part of everyday survival.Much of the film's charm comes from the authenticity of the characters of the Hmong family next door, most of whom do not speak English.

The heart of the film is the relationship between Walt and Thao and this develops with absolute realism. Eastwood never lets a hint of sentimentality creep in as the story reaches its climactic conclusion, when gravitas sets in and our emotions are put through the ringer.

VIt's one of the great tragic true stories of the old wild West, the story of two outlaw friends ending up enemies as one turns over and becomes a lawman  - expressly for the purpose of hunting down his friend. But this film of it was made under poisonous conditions, bedevilled by bad weather and a Peckinpah who was a genius for the first four hours of a day's shoot, before vaporizing himself in alcohol. The story of the shoot is almost as gripping as the story of the film, and in the end, the film is a pale shadow of what it might have been. But this 2 disc release goes a long way to reinstate the film's good name, being closer to Sam Peckinpah's vision than the original 1973 studio release. For instance, it contains a bitter scene between Pat Garret (James Coburn) and his wife, which adds a whole new layer to the character.The difficulties are hardly seen in the film, although there is a certain disjointed quality to the story. All six credited editors laboured over the material - some of which was unusable and was re-shot in guerrilla conditions, against the orders of MGM President Jim Aubrey. The allegory Peckinpah was anxious to push in this story has not been successfully told, namely the damage that shady politicians were causing the American social fabric.But James Coburn is mesmerising (we can't even tell he was sick as a dog for some scenes) and Kris Kristofferson maintains a flawed romantic character whose fate is sealed - and he knows it. Bob Dylan, in his acting debut, is little used, but is of interest value.The commentary on Disc 1 provides useful and informed context from people who know and respect Peckinpah's work. On Disc 2, the same commentators discuss the different version of the so called Preview (or Director's) cut. It's 7 minutes longer than the 2005 version. And the reasons are discussed. Also on Disc 2 are fascinating insights about the making of the film (and other relevant bits) from Peckinpah's one time assistant and partner at the time, Katy Haber, in Deconstructing Pat and Billy.Published August 14, 2008\u000a\u000a\u000a

VBumbling, educated lawyer John Reid (Hammer) is thrown into Tonto's path when saving the Indian from psychopathic outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner, who cameo'd in The Dark Knight and here plays a flamboyant villain with a scarred mouth).\u000a\u000aReid is deputised by his brother (James Badge Dale, last seen in Iron Man 3) and the hunt is on for Cavendish.  But, a railroad is being driven through the West and tyrannical capitalist Cole (Wilkinson, himself a villain in Batman Begins) soon has Reid and Tonto in his sights when they start threatening the venture that will make him rich, his muscle being the US Army.\u000a\u000aDespite worries that Depp would portray Tonto as a ridiculous Jack Sparrow-alike, his performance is one of the film's strengths.\u000aPitched somewhere between Edward Scissorhands and his caricature of Hunter S Thompson in Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas, his Tonto is not the servant of the 50s serial, but a warrior cracked by a past tragedy that he seeks to avenge.\u000a\u000aInstead Hammer is on buffoon detail, taking the film's duration to evolve from inexperienced, civilised lawyer to rootin' tootin' gunslinger.  With echoes of James Stewart's character in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Hammer's engaging performance means he deserves at least one more shot at A-list leading man before being consigned to the Taylor Kitsch bin.\u000a\u000aLiberal lashings of Sergio Leone's spaghetti style are applied to the film's look and feel.  An attack on Reid's sister-in-laws' ranch is straight out of Once Upon A Time In The West, with small natural sounds amplified for tension before the villains' assault.\u000a\u000aThe ubiquitous Hans Zimmer's score is indebted to Ennio Morricone's Italian classics, and the William Tell overture gets a sonic makeover for the riotous railroad finale.\u000a\u000aVerbinski clearly knows how to stage action, with outstanding train-based set-pieces bracketing the film.  Largely flawless CGI blends with impressive practical stunt work, the director boasting Spielberg's flair in staging three different action scenes in one and tying them together.\u000a\u000aHe also peppers arresting moments throughout the indulgent running time; from Reid's deputy badge being melted into the bullet with which he'll take revenge to a women's temperance union marching through a Sodom and Gomorrah style carnival.\u000aUltimately, Depp, Bruckheimer and Verbinski has just about Hi-Yo Silver got away with it..

V \u000a\u000a\u000aYou can\u2019t fault Disney for pitching The Lone Ranger as \u2018Pirates of the Wild West\u2019. But while you can hold a bright candle to that comparison, Gore Verbinski\u2019s ability to imitate the earnest enjoyment of its source material is what really shines through. The familiar greed, land confiscation, political corruption, and attempted genocide that come with screen depictions of American Natives vs. The White Man serve as background fodder here. The real story comes with Johnny Depp\u2019s Tonto moulding Armie Hammer\u2019s goody-two-shoes John Reid into the hero he could be \u2013 though he would have preferred his brother Dan Reid. It\u2019s all book-ended by an older Tonto retelling the adventure to a young-un \u2013 a narrative device that could have been chopped off the two-and-a-half hour running time. Johnny doesn\u2019t take his Jack Sparrow shtick to new Depp-ths, but Hammer feeds off his antics far better than Orlando Bloom ever did. William Fichtner brings a great cob of corn to his savage outlaw Butch, Helena Bonham Carter is effectively distracting as a dolled-up professional \u2018dancer\u2019 and Tom Wilkinson does a good Tom Wilkinson impression. It\u2019s too bad that Luther\u2019s Ruth Wilson is underused as a distressed damsel involved a weird incest-in-law romantic sub-plot. The constant wackiness of The Lone Ranger seems jarring in this modern age of frowny-faced blockbusters. Yet the cheesy tone acts as momentum to justify the creative absurdity of its finale, a dual train chase that features all manner of stunts that lean towards the right side of ridiculous. The result is an action sequence so vastly joyous that it nudges a three-star film into four-star territory.

And, this kid dressed up as Woody in \u201cToy Story\u201d asks Tonto if the legend of The Lone Ranger was true, or just a story. Tonto relates his adventures although his memory appears foggy at times. He\u2019s got to be over 90, maybe a hundred. Anyway, John Reid (Hammer) is a prosecuting attorney determined to bring peace and justice to Texas as the transcontinental railroad is linked. He doesn\u2019t fare well after being deputized as a Texas Ranger by his brother so he can help bring an escaped killer to justice. His brother is killed, but Reid won\u2019t see red. He still believes that everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Ho hum! \u201cThe Lone Ranger\u201d is the story of how Reid gets his mind changed on how to dispense the law. Tonto and Reid find a common interest, revenge. But, they initially don\u2019t get along. Depp brings his usual quirkiness to the role of Tonto. He\u2019s often amusing. But, Hammer is plain vanilla as the masked lawman. He never quite makes the role truly his. And, his transformation to vigilante trods along without much real emotion. On the down side, the film is way too long at two and a half hours. Way too violent for Disney. And, quite anachronistic. That\u2019s a fancy word for stuff that ain\u2019t supposed to be in the film\u2019s time period. All movies suffer from this.

Just as Gore Verbinski's rollicking Pirates of the Caribbean franchise let us taste the salt spray and feel the lurch of the waves, here the smell of dust in the vast, arid desert settings almost permeates from the screen alongside the rumbling of the 19th century stream train. The plot is rich and colourful and with a hi-ho Silver, non-stop humour and fast action; there is much to enjoy in the company of the incongruous trio of an in-form Depp, a suitably dashing Armie Hammer and a scene stealing white horse with a personality all of its own.Screenwriters Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio (Pirates) and Justin Haythe (Revolutionary Road) have structured the screenplay so that it is Tonto's recollections of the action that form the exposition. The framing occurs when a peanut-munching young boy wearing a mask studiously observes the exhibit in a travelling circus in which an aged, paunchy Tonto, black bird perched on head stands immobile beside a stuffed buffalo and bear as The Noble Savage. The mechanism is utilized once too often, though. From 1933, we are thrown headlong into the adventure some 60 years earlier when Tonto and District Attorney John Reid (Hammer) meet in silver-rich country on the train to the future and are thrown, shackled and propelled together for the rest of the film.All the elements of a grand adventure are there with a dash of romance, a deformed outlaw in William Fitchner's Butch Cavendish, a man with a taste for human flesh plus a conniving villain in Tom Wilkinson, whose outwardly respectable, two-faced Latham Cole makes our skin crawl. Helena Bonham Carter is a colourful addition as the buxom, flame-haired Madam at the House of Sin whose decorative prosthetic leg conceals surprises even for a Madam.Hammer, with his handsome looks and clean-cut manner is perfectly cast as the lawman who likes to uphold the law by the book and not with a bullet and is a likeable presence, epitomizing decency. By contrast, Depp's Tonto is a man of action not words and Depp milks the odd-couple relationship for all its worth with his naturally eccentric manner and understated delivery. One of the elements I enjoyed about the film is its absurdities - like the shot of the horse Silver wearing the Lone Ranger's hat and the mayhem that Tonto precipitates as he pops up in unexpected places.The stunts are huge, the vistas arresting and the final climactic charge with its daring action on the roof of two speeding trains is accompanied by a rousing, orchestral version of Rossini's William Tell Overture, galloping along at full throttle. Those who remember the TV series fondly should not compare - as the expression goes, there are different courses for different horses. Mind you, the film is overlong and could be sharply edited, but there is plenty of fun to be had with Depp, just sit back and enjoy the ride.Review by Andrew L. Urban

In the original, it was a physical lie detector....so this is the signature element for Jack's character, underlining his persona as a man who thinks the truth is that simple. Jack, to be sure, is a simple sort of conservative, whose catch phrases about 'the circle of trust' are the running gag through both Meet The Parents and now Meet The Fockers - or the other set of parents.Perhaps the filmmakers hoped that we the audience would also remain within their circle of trust, rehashing the concept and taking it to its logically humorous conclusion. We are willing, but the script is weak. The expensive cast is given cheap jokes and overstatement kills nearly every idea that emerges from the writers. The basic concept relies on the thrusting together of two sets of opposites in the Byrnes and the Fockers (not unlike La Cage aux Folles, but executed with less creative flair) in which all the predictable gags can be worked up into bits of business. And sure, some do work, at least on a simplistic level. There are even a couple of moments of soft core political satire aimed at the conservative flanks of US society, with lines from Jack the patriot.But the script strays too far from genuine character, turning everyone into monstrous exaggerations of their personas, or in the case of Pam (Teri Polo) going in the opposite direction and making her a shallow fixture on the back wall. Ben Stiller does his Ben Stiller routine and you either buy it or not, and DeNiro makes an unlikebable, inflexible and downright rude Jack seem at once anti-American in nature, and pro-America in military terms. Hoffman and Streisand work well as a life loving couple, energising their scenes with a credible strain of madcap fun.The other human star is a toddler who doesn't speak, the Byrnes' grandson, put through several scenes where he is made to ape for the camera. Other scenes in which he's genuinely upset are not so entertaining; his frequent presence seems to be entirely motivated by the rather thin payoff of him making a rough attempt at (vaguely) repeating the one word from Gaylord's vocabulary that he shouldn't

V\u000aTargeted at teenage girls, Uptown Girls is a highly improbable and manipulative coming of age fantasy about two opposites who act anything but their age, but end up turning their lives around. The film revolves around Brittany Murphy\u2019s wacky turn as the spoilt little rich girl who acts like a kid, and Dakota Fanning\u2019s precocious hypochondriac of a kid who acts like a grown up.  Both misfits with father issues, Molly and Ray take a dislike to each other at first glance.  But when it is patently clear that Molly is not well equipped to join the work force (she falls asleep in the Manchester department of her first job in sales), it is only through her connections that she gets the job as nanny to this little girl, who sourly spits out \u2018Act your age, not your shoe size\u2019.

V bumbling amateurs, cool professionals,\u000aflamboyant madmen, steely psychopaths, old lags, young go-getters, and the dodgy but\u000adecent lads caught in the middle. In this respect, Snatch improves on its predecessor by\u000aincluding a wider range of social and ethnic groups (with space for ambiguous figures like\u000aDoug the Head, who's in the diamond trade and therefore tries to convince everyone he's\u000aJewish) and throwing a couple of zany American actors into the mix. Despite (or because\u000aof) their varying performance styles, the ensemble cast blend well together - though the\u000acomplex plot inevitably reduces all the characters to flat counters who can be randomly\u000ashuffled round in a series of (often fatal) confrontations. Ritchie's stylistic\u000aflourishes, such as throwing the action into fast motion, tend to increase this feeling of\u000ajokey detachment. The plot itself, unfortunately, is less well-contrived than that of the\u000aearlier film - and the abrupt ending is a distinct anticlimax. But on the whole I'd say\u000athe two movies come out about even. So if you liked Lock, Stock\u2026"\u000aJake Wilson\u000a"Signwriters around the world breathed a huge sigh of relief when the title of\u000athis movie was announced.

Yep, the swindlers and sadists and descriptive monikers \u2013 like\u000aFranky Four Fingers \u2013 are all here; as are the directorial pop-mannerisms

V \u000a\u000a\u000aFilled to the brim as it was with some of the finest older British actors around, 2012\u2032s sleeper smash The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was often referred to as \u2018The Avengers for pensioners\u2019. Which I suppose would make this follow-up \u2018Age of Ultron for pensioners\u2019. The level of quality sustained in this sequel bodes well for Joss Whedon\u2019s impending blockbuster. The superlatively talented cast is effortlessly engaging, and while there isn\u2019t a huge amount of drama in their various arcs, it\u2019s still a significant delight to spend more time in their company. Maggie Smith in particular is the heart and soul of these films, and this often feels like a well-deserved ode to her unique charms. Bill Nighy and Judi Dench also manage to inject some life into the well-worn \u2018Will they or won\u2019t they?\u2019 trope. New cast additions Richard Gere and Tamsin Grieg (the Quicksilver Fox and Scarlet Witch of this film?) fit into the environment nicely, with Gere once again proving his worth as an old-fashioned romantic leading man. A misjudged subplot about murder-for-hire aside, this rarely puts a foot wrong. More sequels could stand to be this tuned in to what their audiences want.

VWhile it's agreeable to spend another interlude with the characters we met four years ago in the first film, this second chapter is too slight, too laboured and too long to warrant as much attention. While Ol Parker's screenplay soared the first time around, it struggles to keep our interest with contrived story strands that beggar belief. Having said that, John Madden's film shines brightest by its Indian content - through its authentic, colourful backdrop and serial spouting of Kipling quotes by Dev Patel's overly earnest hotel manager Sonny Kapoor. The construct is sound, using Sonny's upcoming nuptials to form its pillars, however, the mood is somewhat tarred by a miscalculation that leaves us with a coating of melancholy, instead of the feel-good vibe for which we crave.Before returning to India, the story begins incongruously with Sonny speeding on Route 66 in a convertible, Maggie Smith's Muriel Donnelly complaining vehemently. Their mission is to find financing for a second hotel; the first in which old age has been outsourced, is so successful, its regular guests only vacate when the heavens beckon. The references to death are humorous and the daily roll call alerts one and all, should the time of any of the residents have arrived. Smith is a formidable presence throughout and I liked the tension between her Muriel and Judi Dench's Evelyn Greenslade. My favourite Maggie Smith quote

V\u000aWe all knew DVD was going to be big, but this is BIG. Over 4 hours of movies and 10 hours (yep, 10 hours) of extra features are packed into this three-disc set.\u000a\u000aThe big attraction here, of course, is the original Back to the Future, the film that launched Michael J Fox\u2019s career as a film actor and established Robert Zemeckis as a bankable Hollywood director. The producers of the DVD package have recognised its importance by devoting the bulk of the special features to this part of the trilogy.\u000a\u000aThe film itself remains an enjoyable experience and hasn\u2019t dated nearly as badly as many other films from the era (it was released in 1985). With its engaging characters, intriguing plot and feel-good sensibility, it continues to be a likeable film for young and not-so-young. \u000a\u000aBut the film becomes almost secondary to the mammoth amount of material on this DVD. One of the best innovations I\u2019ve seen for a while is a feature titled Did You Know That? Universal\u2019s Animated Anecdotes. This basically flashes up little tidbits of information about the film as you\u2019re watching it (like the fact that the school used in the film was Richard Nixon\u2019s alma mater). This is great for trivia buffs and anyone wanting to delve into the film in greater detail. \u000a\u000aThis film is also the only one on the DVD to be accompanied by a commentary. The commentary in fact is an extended Q & A session with Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale (the writer with whom Zemeckis collaborated on all three Back to the Future films). As a result, the commentary at any given moment isn\u2019t necessarily pertinent to what\u2019s happening on-screen at the time. It does however provide a lot of background information about the film and how it was made.\u000a\u000aOne word for the technically unskilled (like myself), once you turn the commentary on, you may find it something of a tall order to turn it off.\u000a\u000aSome of the information from the commentary is repeated in the \u201cMaking the Trilogy\u201d featurette in which the filmmakers look back on their experiences in making the film. This is a much slicker production than the \u201cMaking of\u201d featurette, which dates from the time the film was released, but for my money, the latter is the better value.\u000a\u000aNot only do we get to see the filmmakers and actors talking about the film without the benefit of hindsight, it features hilarious footage of Steven Spielberg (who produced the film) as he was in 1985. Far from the slick operator we know today, he appears with one of the worst haircut-sunglasses combinations ever put on film. In fact, if it weren\u2019t for the on-screen identification, few would recognise him as the man who went on to make Schindler\u2019s List.\u000a\u000aOnce you\u2019ve been through the first disc though, things start to go downhill. Back to the Future II, while it had a great premise and some wonderful scenes, particularly in the latter part of the film, never really worked. This is partly due to the clunky \u201cfuture\u201d scenes, which today seem quaint at best and laughable at worst. \u000a\u000aLike the original, the bonus material accompanying Part II includes the original \u201cmaking of\u201d featurette, as well as Chapter 2 of the Making of the Trilogy. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no commentary with this one, nor any neat pop-up information. \u000a\u000aBy the time we get to Part III however, the producers of the DVD have just about thrown up their hands. The film itself just doesn\u2019t work, and in parts it smacks of desperation. In addition, there\u2019s not even a \u201cmaking of\u201d featurette to accompany it. While we have the Making the Trilogy Chapter 3, about the coolest thing on this disc is the outtakes reel (unless of course, you\u2019re into ZZ Top, who provide a music video).\u000a\u000aAll three discs include outtakes reels (all of which are pretty funny) and deleted scenes. While these are fine as far as they go, I personally always prefer to have some commentary to provide insight into why they were deleted in the first place. They all have production archives featuring original photographs, storyboards and props, as well as storyboard to feature comparisons \u2013 all good stuff.\u000a\u000aThe Back to the Future Trilogy will no doubt be a must-have for fans of the series. For the average DVD buyer, this is a value-packed set. Sure, Part III isn\u2019t much chop, but there\u2019s so much good stuff here on Part I (in particular) and Part II, that the quality of the third film can virtually be overlooked. \u000a\u000aPublished August 22, 2002
